        "Scenic and vividly detailed descriptions": [
          "1. At half past six on the twenty-first of June 1922, when Count Alexander Ilyich Rostov was escorted through the gates of the Kremlin onto Red Square, it was glorious and cool. Drawing his shoulders back without breaking stride, the Count inhaled the air like one fresh from a swim. The sky was the very blue that the cupolas of St. Basil’s had been painted for. Their pinks, greens, and golds shimmered as if it were the sole purpose of a religion to cheer its Divinity.",
          "2. Passing through Resurrection Gate, he turned his back on the lilacs of the Alexander Gardens and proceeded toward Theatre Square, where the Hotel Metropol stood in all its glory.",
          "3. This attic was originally built to house the butlers and ladies’ maids of the Metropol’s guests; but when the practice of traveling with servants fell out of fashion, the unused rooms had been claimed by the caprices of casual urgency—thenceforth warehousing scraps of lumber, broken furniture, and other assorted debris.",
          "4. How many mornings dressed in his robe with his coffee in hand had he observed the new arrivals from St. Petersburg disembarking from their cabs, worn and weary from the overnight train?",
          "5. The Count stood and banged his head on the slope of the ceiling. Easing one of the high-back chairs aside and moving the elephant lamps to the bed, the Count opened his trunk."
        ],
        "Abstract or symbolic imagery": [
          "1. A king fortifies himself with a castle, a gentleman with a desk.",
          "2. ’Tis a funny thing, reflected the Count as he stood ready to abandon his suite... But experience is less likely to teach us how to bid our dearest possessions adieu.",
          "3. And once the trunk had been carried upstairs, he finally pointed to the desk. 'It weighs a ton,' said one to the other. 'A king fortifies himself with a castle,' observed the Count, 'a gentleman with a desk.'",
          "4. Until we imagine that these carefully preserved possessions might give us genuine solace in the face of a lost companion. But, of course, a thing is just a thing.",
          "5. For such would have been the quarters of Captain Nemo when he journeyed twenty thousand leagues beneath the sea. And wouldn’t any young boy with the slightest gumption gladly trade a hundred nights in a palace for one aboard the Nautilus?"
        ],
        "Intense, action-packed scenes": [
          "1. Back down the belfry he skipped as the guards hurried behind him, their rifles clacking against the wall.",
          "2. Then he vaulted the steps two at a time, as had been his habit since the academy.",
          "3. Leaping into the waiting carriage, he'd flash across the city, vault the fabled steps, and like this young fellow slip through the golden doors.",
          "4. As the bellhops lugged it into the hall, the Rostovs’ grandfather clock, which was fated to be left behind, tolled a doleful eight.",
          "5. To the Metropol!” they replied. The Count was something of a natural-born host and in the hour that ensued, as he topped a glass here and sparked a conversation there, he had an instinctive awareness of all the temperaments in the room."
        ],
        "Difficult-to-understand but visually striking passages": [
          "1. There, several duly goateed officers of the current regime determined that for the crime of being born an aristocrat, I should be sentenced to spend the rest of my days . . . in this hotel.",
          "2. At that very instant, at the square’s northern extreme a young Red Army officer rushed up the steps of the Bolshoi, having missed the first half hour of the evening’s performance.",
          "3. Whether one’s leanings were left or right, Red or White, whether one’s personal circumstances had changed for the better or changed for the worse, surely at long last it was time to drink to the health of the nation.",
          "4. In other words, it was a desk to be reckoned with. Emptying his glass, the Count pushed his chair back and sat on the floor. He ran his hand behind the desk’s right front leg until he found the catch. When he pressed it, a seamless door opened to reveal a velvet-lined hollow that, like the hollows in the other three legs, was stacked with pieces of gold.",
          "5. We carry them from place to place, often at considerable expense and inconvenience; we dust and polish their surfaces and reprimand children for playing too roughly in their vicinity—all the while, allowing memories to invest them with greater and greater importance."
        ],
        "Interesting and imaginative descriptions": [
          "1. The scissors were so delicate he could barely fit his thumb and finger through the rings. Fashioned in the shape of an egret with the long silver blades representing the bird’s beak and the small golden screw at the pivot representing its eye.",
          "2. This efficiency of design was music to the young mind. It attested to a precision of purpose and the promise of adventure.",
          "3. Then he kneeled before the Ambassador, threw the clasps, and opened it like a giant book. Carefully secured inside were fifty-two glasses—or more precisely, twenty-six pairs of glasses—each shaped to its purpose.",
          "4. Though the window was only the size of a dinner invitation, the Count could see that a pigeon had landed outside on the copper stripping of the ledge.",
          "5. The Count ran his hand across the desk’s dimpled surface. How many of the Grand Duke’s words did those faint indentations reflect? Here over forty years had been written concise instructions to caretakers; persuasive arguments to statesmen; exquisite counsel to friends."
