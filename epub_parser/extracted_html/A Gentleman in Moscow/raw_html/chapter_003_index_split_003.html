  <body><p class="calibre1">“I see you are still presiding over tables at the Boyarsky.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes,” he said with a smile, though unsure from her businesslike tone whether he should take the remark as a compliment or criticism. . . . He was tempted in turn to ask (with a glint in his eye) if she had had an “hors d’oeuvre” at the Piazza, but thought better of it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I gather you are on the verge of an adventure,” he said instead. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I suppose there will be adventurous aspects,” she replied. “But mostly there will be a good deal of work.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The four of them, she explained, were leaving the next morning with ten other cadres of local Komsomol youth for the Kady District—an ancient agricultural center in the heart of the Ivanovo Province—to aid the <i class="calibre3">udarniks</i>, or “shock workers,” in the collectivization of the region. At the end of 1928, only 10 percent of the farms in Ivanovo had been operating as collectives. By the end of 1931, nearly all of them would be. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“For generations the kulaks have farmed the land for themselves, organizing the local peasant labor to their own ends. But the time has come for the common land to serve the common good. It is a historical necessity,” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p184"/><img src="index-184_1.jpg" class="calibre2"/></p>
<p class="calibre1">she added matter-of-factly, “an inevitability. After all, does a teacher only teach his own children? Does a physician only care for his parents?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">As Nina began this little speech, the Count was taken aback for a moment by her tone and terminology—by her exacting assessment of kulaks and the “inevitable” need for collectivization. But when she tucked her hair behind her ears, he realized that her fervor shouldn’t have come as a surprise. She was simply bringing to the Komsomol the same unwavering enthusiasm and precise attention to detail that she had brought to the mathematics of Professor Lisitsky. Nina Kulikova always was and would be a serious soul in search of serious ideas to be serious about. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nina had told her comrades that she would only be a minute, but as she elaborated on the work that lay ahead, she seemed to forget that they were still standing on the other side of the potted palm. </p>
<p class="calibre1">With an inward smile, the Count noted over her shoulder that the handsome captain, having volunteered to wait for Nina, was sending the others on ahead—a reasonable gambit under any ideology. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I should go,” she said, after drawing her remarks to a close. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes. Absolutely,” replied the Count. “You must have a great deal to see to.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">In sober acknowledgment, she shook his hand; and when she turned, she barely seemed to notice that two of her comrades had already left—as if having a handsome fellow wait for her was something to which she had already become accustomed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As the two young idealists left the hotel, the Count watched through the revolving doors. He watched as the young man spoke to Pavel, and Pavel signaled a taxi. But when the taxi appeared and the young man opened the door, Nina gestured across Theatre Square, indicating that she was headed in another direction. The handsome captain made a similar gesture, presumably offering to accompany her, but Nina shook his hand just as soberly as she had shaken the Count’s and then walked across the square in the general direction of historical necessity. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Isn’t that more of a cream than a pearl?” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p185"/>Together, the Count and Marina were staring at a spool that she had just taken from a drawer filled with threads in every possible shade of white. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I am so sorry, Your Excellency,” Marina replied. “Now that you bring it to my attention, it does seem more creamy than pearly.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The Count looked up from the spool into Marina’s stationary eye, which was filled with concern; but her wandering eye seemed filled with mirth. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Then she laughed like a schoolgirl. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh, give me that,” he said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Here,” she said in a conciliatory tone. “Let me.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Absolutely not.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh, come now.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’m perfectly capable of doing it myself, thank you.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">But to the Count’s credit, he was not simply making a peevish point. He was, in fact, perfectly capable of doing it himself. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It stands to reason that if you wish to be a good waiter you must be master of your own appearance. You must be clean, well groomed, and graceful. But you must also be neatly dressed. You certainly can’t wander around the dining room with fraying collars or cuffs. And God forbid you should presume to serve with a dangling button—for next thing you knew, it would be floating in a customer’s vichyssoise. So, three weeks after joining the staff of the Boyarsky, the Count had asked Marina to teach him Arachne’s art. To be conservative, the Count had set aside an hour for the lesson. It ended up taking eight hours over the course of four weeks. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Who knew that there was such a plethora of stitches? The backstitch, cross-stitch, slip stitch, topstitch, whipstitch. Aristotle, Larousse, and Diderot—those great encyclopedists who spent their lives segmenting, cataloging, and defining all manner of phenomena—would never have imagined that there were so many, and each one suited to a different purpose! </p>
<p class="calibre1">With his creamy thread in hand, the Count settled himself into a chair; and when Marina held out her pincushion, he surveyed the needles as a child surveys chocolates in a box. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“This one,” he said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Licking the thread and closing an eye (just as Marina had taught him), the Count threaded the needle faster than saints enter the gates of heaven. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Forming a double loop, tying off a knot, and snipping the thread from the</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p186"/>spool, the Count sat upright and set about his work as Marina set about hers (the repair of a pillowcase). </p>
<p class="calibre1">As with any sewing circle since the beginning of time, the two in this one were accustomed to sharing observations from their day as they stitched. Most of these observations were met with a  <i class="calibre3">Hmm</i>, or an  <i class="calibre3">Is that so? </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">without a break in the rhythm of the work; but occasionally, some item that warranted greater attention would bring the stitching to a stop. Just so, having exchanged remarks on the weather, and Pavel’s handsome new topcoat, Marina’s needle suddenly froze in midstitch when the Count mentioned that he had run into Nina. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Nina Kulikova?” she asked in surprise. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“None other.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Where?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“In the lobby. She had been having lunch with three of her comrades.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Did you speak?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“At some length.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What did she have to say for herself?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It seems they are off to Ivanovo to rationalize kulaks and collectivize tractors, and what have you.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Never mind that, Alexander. How  <i class="calibre3">was</i> she?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Here the Count stopped his stitching. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“She was every bit herself,” he said after a moment. “Still full of curiosity and passion and self-assurance.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Wonderful,” Marina said with a smile. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The Count watched as she resumed her stitching. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“And yet . . .” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Marina stopped again and met his gaze. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“And yet?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">. . . </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It’s nothing.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Alexander. There is clearly something on your mind.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">. . . </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It’s just that to hear Nina talk of her upcoming journey, she is so passionate, so self-assured, and perhaps so single-minded, that she seems almost humorless. Like some dauntless explorer, she seems ready to place her flag in a polar ice cap and claim it in the name of Inevitability. But I</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p187"/>can’t help suspecting that all the while, her happiness may be waiting in another latitude altogether.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Come now, Alexander. Little Nina must be nearly eighteen. Surely, when you were that age you and your friends spoke with passion and self-assurance.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Of course we did,” said the Count. “We sat in cafés and argued about ideas until they mopped the floors and doused the lights.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well, there you are.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It’s true that we argued about ideas, Marina; but we never had any intention of doing anything about them.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Marina rolled one of her eyes. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Heaven forbid you should do something about an idea.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No, I am serious. Nina is so determined, I fear that the force of her convictions will interfere with the joys of her youth.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Marina put her sewing in her lap. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You have always been fond of little Nina.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Of course I have.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“And in part, that is because she is such an independent spirit.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Precisely.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Then you must trust in her. And even if she is single-minded to a fault, you must trust that life will find her in time. For eventually, it finds us all.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The Count nodded for a moment, reflecting on Marina’s position. Then returning to his task, he looped through the button’s holes, wound the shank, tied off the knot, and snapped the thread with his teeth. Poking Marina’s needle back into its cushion, he noted it was already 4:05, a fact that confirmed once again how quickly time flies when one is immersed in a pleasant task accompanied by pleasant conversation. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Wait a moment . . . , thought the Count. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Already 4:05? </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Great Scott!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Thanking Marina, the Count grabbed his jacket, dashed to the lobby, and vaulted up the stairs two by two. When he arrived at suite 311, he found the door ajar. Looking left and looking right, he slipped inside and closed the door. </p>
<p class="calibre1">On the side table before an ornate mirror were the two-foot tiger lilies that had passed him earlier in the day. After taking a quick look around, the</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p188"/>Count crossed the empty sitting room and entered the bedchamber, where a willowy figure stood in silhouette before one of the great windows. At the sound of his approach, she turned and let her dress slip to the floor with a delicate whoosh. . . . </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p189"/><img src="index-189_1.jpg" class="calibre2"/></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3"><b class="calibre4">An Afternoon Assignation</b></i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">After taking a quick look around, the Count crossed the empty sitting room</i> <i class="calibre3">and entered the bedchamber, where a willowy figure stood in silhouette</i> <i class="calibre3">before one of the great windows. At the sound of his approach, she turned</i> <i class="calibre3">and let her dress slip to the floor with a delicate whoosh. . . . </i></p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre4">W</b>hat’s this! </p>
<p class="calibre1">When we last left this pair in 1923, did not Anna Urbanova dismiss the Count with a definitive instruction to “draw the curtains”? And when he closed the door behind him with a click, did he not assume the aspect of a ghost before drifting forlornly to the roof? And now, as she slips beneath the bedcovers, this once haughty figure offers a smile suggestive of patience, tenderness, even gratitude—traits that are mirrored almost exactly in the smile of her former adversary as he hangs the white jacket of the Boyarsky on the back of a chair and begins to unbutton his shirt! </p>
<p class="calibre1">What possibly could have happened to reunite these contrary souls? </p>
<p class="calibre1">What twisting path could have led them to suite 311 and back into each other’s arms? </p>
<p class="calibre1">Well, it was not the path of the Count that twisted. For Alexander Rostov had spent the intervening years traveling up and down the Metropol’s staircase from his bedroom to the Boyarsky and back again. No, the path that twisted, turned, veered, and doubled back was not the Count’s; it was Anna’s. </p>
<p class="calibre1">When we first encountered Miss Urbanova in the Metropol’s lobby in 1923, the haughtiness the Count noted in her bearing was not without foundation, for it was a by-product of her unambiguous celebrity. Discovered in a</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p190"/>regional theater on the outskirts of Odessa in 1919 by Ivan Rosotsky, Anna was cast as leading lady in his next two films. Both of these were historical romances that celebrated the moral purity of those who toiled, while disparaging the corruption of those who did not. In the first, Anna played an eighteenth-century kitchen maid for whom a young nobleman abandons the trappings of court. In the second, she was a nineteenth-century heiress who turns her back on her legacy to wed a blacksmith’s apprentice. Setting his fables in the palaces of yesteryear, Rosotsky lit them in the hazy aura of dreams, shot them in the soft focus of memories, and capped the first, second, and third acts with close-ups of his starlet: Anna aspiring; Anna distraught; Anna at long last in love. Both of the films were popular with the public, both found favor with the Politburo (which was eager to give the People some respite from the war years through suitably themed diversions), and our young starlet reaped the effortless rewards of fame. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In 1921, Anna was given membership in the All-Russian Film Union and access to its dedicated stores; in 1922 she was given use of a dacha near Peterhof; and in 1923 she was given the mansion of a former fur merchant furnished with gilded chairs, painted armoires, and a Louis Quatorze dresser—all of which could easily have been props in one of Rosotsky’s films. It was at her soirées in this house that Anna mastered the ancient art of descending a staircase. With one hand on the banister and the train of a long silk dress behind her, she descended step by step while painters, authors, actors, and senior members of the Party waited at the foot of the stair. <a href="index_split_006.html#p459">*</a></p>
<p class="calibre1">But art is the most unnatural minion of the state. Not only is it created by fanciful people who tire of repetition even more quickly than they tire of being told what to do, it is also vexingly ambiguous. Just when a carefully crafted bit of dialogue is about to deliver a crystal-clear message, a hint of sarcasm or the raising of an eyebrow can spoil the entire effect. In fact, it can give credence to a notion that is the exact opposite of that which was intended. So, perhaps it is understandable that governing authorities are bound to reconsider their artistic preferences every now and then, if for no other reason than to keep themselves fit. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Sure enough, at the Moscow premiere of Rosotsky’s fourth film with Anna as leading lady (in which, playing the part of a princess mistaken for an orphan, she falls in love with an orphan mistaken for a prince), it was</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p191"/>noted by the savvy in the orchestra section that General Secretary Stalin, who was known so endearingly in his youth as Soso, was not smiling as wholeheartedly at the screen as he had in the past. Instinctively, they restrained their own enthusiasm, which tempered the enthusiasm of those in the mezzanine, which in turn tempered those in the balcony—until everyone in the house could sense that something was afoot. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Two days after the premiere, an open letter was written to  <i class="calibre3">Pravda</i> by an up-and-coming apparatchik (who had been sitting just a few seats behind Soso). The film was entertaining in its way, he conceded, but what was one to make of Rosotsky’s incessant return to the era of princes and princesses? </p>
<p class="calibre1">Of waltzing and candlelight and marble stairs? Had not his fascination with the past begun to smell suspiciously of nostalgia? And once again, does not his story line seem centered on the trials and triumphs of the individual? A predilection that he reinforces by his rather excessive reliance on the close-up? Yes, we have another beautiful woman in another beautiful gown, but where is the historical immediacy? And where the collective struggle? </p>
<p class="calibre1">Four days after the letter appeared in  <i class="calibre3">Pravda</i>, Soso took a moment before addressing the Plenum to approach this new film critic and compliment him on his turns of phrase. Two weeks after the Plenum, the substance of the letter (and a few of its turns of phrase) were echoed in three more newspapers and a journal of the arts. The film received limited distribution to second-rate theaters, where it was met with muted applause. </p>
<p class="calibre1">By that autumn, not only was Rosotsky’s next project up in the air, his political reliability had come into question. . . . </p>
<p class="calibre1">An ingénue in film but not in life, Anna understood that Rosotsky’s fall from grace was a stone that could quickly drag her to the depths. She began avoiding public appearances in his company, while openly praising the aesthetics of other directors; and this stratagem might well have succeeded in securing her a new avenue of stardom but for an unfortunate development across the Atlantic: the talking picture. While Anna’s face was still one of the most alluring on screen, audiences who for years had imagined her speaking in dulcet tones were not prepared to hear her husky tenor. Thus, in the spring of 1928, at the sprightly age of twenty-nine, Anna Urbanova was what the Americans would have called a has-been. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Alas, while the copper plate on the bottom of a priceless antique may allow a good comrade to sleep soundly, it is the nature of objects with serial</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p192"/><img src="index-192_1.jpg" class="calibre2"/></p>
<p class="calibre1">numbers set down in ledgers that they may be reclaimed and put to new use at the stroke of a pen. In a matter of months, the gilded chairs, painted armoires, and Louis Quatorze dresser were all gone—as was the fur merchant’s mansion and the Peterhof dacha—and Anna found herself with two trunks of clothing in the street. In her purse she still had train fare to her hometown outside Odessa. Instead, she moved into a one-room apartment with her sixty-year-old dresser, for Anna Urbanova had no intention of going home ever again. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The second time the Count saw Anna was in November 1928, about eight months after she had lost her mansion. He was just pouring water into the glass of an Italian importer when she walked through the door of the Boyarsky wearing a red sleeveless dress and high-heeled shoes. As the Count apologized to the importer and attempted to mop his lap with a napkin, he overheard the actress explain to Andrey that she would be joined by a guest at any moment. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Andrey led her to a table for two in the corner. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Forty minutes later her guest arrived. </p>
<p class="calibre1">From his vantage point on the other side of the Boyarsky’s centerpiece (an arrangement of sunflowers), the Count could tell that the actress and her guest knew each other only by reputation. He was a good-enough-looking fellow, a few years younger than Anna and wearing a tailored jacket, but plainly something of a cad. For having taken his seat, even as he apologized for being late he was already scanning the menu; and when she assured him that it was quite all right, he was already signaling their waiter. For her part, Anna appeared to be perfectly charming. She related her stories with a sparkle in her eye and listened to his with a ready laugh; and she was the very image of patience whenever their conversation was interrupted by someone who had approached the table to fawn over his latest picture. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A few hours later, when the Boyarsky was empty and the kitchen was closed, the Count passed through the lobby just as Anna and her guest emerged from the Shalyapin Bar. As he paused to put on his overcoat, Anna gestured to the elevator, clearly inviting him upstairs for one more drink. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But he continued putting his arms through his sleeves. It was a pleasure</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p193"/>meeting, he assured her with a glance at his watch; unfortunately, he was expected elsewhere. Then he made a beeline for the door. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As the young director crossed the lobby, the Count was of the opinion that Anna looked every bit as radiant as she had in 1923. But the moment the director disappeared into the street, the actress’s smile and shoulders drooped. Then having passed a hand across her brow, she turned from the door—only to meet the gaze of the Count. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In an instant, she drew back her shoulders, raised her chin, and strolled toward the staircase. But having mastered the art of descending the stairs to a gathering of admirers, she had yet to master the art of ascending the stairs alone. (Perhaps no one has.) On the third step, she stopped. She stood motionless. Then she turned, came back down, and crossed to where the Count was standing. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Whenever I am in this lobby with you,” she said, “it seems that I am destined to be humiliated.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The Count looked surprised. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Humiliated? You have no cause to feel humiliated, as far as I can see.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I gather you’re blind.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">She looked toward the revolving door as if it were still spinning from the young director’s exit. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I invited him for a nightcap. He said he had an early start.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I have never had an early start in my life,” said the Count. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Offering her first genuine smile of the evening, she waved a hand at the stairs. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Then you might as well come on up.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">At the time, Anna was staying in room 428. It was not the finest room on the fourth floor, nor was it the worst. Off the small bedroom, it had a small sitting area with a small couch, a small coffee table, and two small windows looking over the trolley tracks on Teatralny Proyezd. It was the room of one who hoped to make an impression when she could not easily afford to do so. On the coffee table were two glasses, a serving of caviar, and a bottle of vodka in a bucket of melting ice. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As they looked over this little  <i class="calibre3">mise-en-scène</i>, she shook her head. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That’ll cost me a pretty penny.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Then we mustn’t let it go to waste.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The Count drew the bottle from the ice and poured them both a glass. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p194"/><img src="index-194_1.jpg" class="calibre2"/></p>
<p class="calibre1">“To old times,” he said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“To old times,” she conceded with a laugh. And they emptied their glasses. </p>
<p class="calibre1">When one experiences a profound setback in the course of an enviable life, one has a variety of options. Spurred by shame, one may attempt to hide all evidence of the change in one’s circumstances. Thus, the merchant who gambles away his savings will hold on to his finer suits until they fray, and tell anecdotes from the halls of the private clubs where his membership has long since lapsed. In a state of self-pity, one may retreat from the world in which one has been blessed to live. Thus, the long-suffering husband, finally disgraced by his wife in society, may be the one who leaves his home in exchange for a small, dark apartment on the other side of town. Or, like the Count and Anna, one may simply join the Confederacy of the Humbled. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Like the Freemasons, the Confederacy of the Humbled is a close-knit brotherhood whose members travel with no outward markings, but who know each other at a glance. For having fallen suddenly from grace, those in the Confederacy share a certain perspective. Knowing beauty, influence, fame, and privilege to be borrowed rather than bestowed, they are not easily impressed. They are not quick to envy or take offense. They certainly do not scour the papers in search of their own names. They remain committed to living among their peers, but they greet adulation with caution, ambition with sympathy, and condescension with an inward smile. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As the actress poured some more vodka, the Count looked about the room. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“How are the dogs?” he asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Better off than I am.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“To the dogs then,” he said, lifting his glass. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes,” she agreed with a smile. “To the dogs.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">And so it began. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Over the next year and a half, Anna would visit the Metropol every few months. In advance, she would reach out to some director she’d known. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Admitting with some relief that her days of appearing in films were behind</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p195"/><img src="index-195_1.jpg" class="calibre2"/></p>
<p class="calibre1">her, she’d invite him to be her guest at the Boyarsky. Having learned her lesson in 1928, she no longer arrived at the restaurant first. By means of a small gratuity to the girl in the coatroom, she ensured that she would arrive two minutes  <i class="calibre3">after</i> her guest. Over dinner, she would confess that she was one of the director’s greatest fans. She would recall favorite elements from several of his films and then dwell on a particular scene—one that was easily overlooked because it involved a secondary character and just a few lines of dialogue, but that had been rendered with such obvious nuance and care. And when Anna had walked her guest to the lobby, she would not suggest a nightcap in the Shalyapin; she certainly wouldn’t invite him for one in her room. She would say, instead, what a pleasure it had been to see him, and then bid him goodnight. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Donning his coat, the director would pause. Watching the elevator doors close, he would acknowledge that Anna Urbanova’s days of stardom were probably behind her—and yet, he would find himself wondering if she might not be perfect for that little role in the second act. </p>
<p class="calibre1">And having let herself into her room on the fourth floor, Anna would change into a simple dress (after hanging her gown in the closet), make herself comfortable with a book, and wait for the Count to arrive. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In the aftermath of one such dinner with an old director friend, Anna was cast for a single scene as a middle-aged worker in a factory that was struggling to meet its quota. With two weeks left in the quarter, the workers gather to compose a letter to the Party leadership that details the causes of their inevitable shortfall. But as they begin to enumerate the various obstacles they have faced, Anna—her hair drawn back in a kerchief—rises to give a short, impassioned speech in favor of pushing on. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As the camera draws closer to this unnamed character, one can see that she is a woman who is no longer young or ravishing, but who remains proud and unbent. And her voice? </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ah, her voice . . . </p>
<p class="calibre1">From the very first words of her speech, the audience can tell that here was no idler. For her voice was that of a woman who has breathed the dust of unpaved roads; who has screamed during childbirth; who has called out</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p196"/><img src="index-196_1.jpg" class="calibre2"/></p>
<p class="calibre1">to her sisters on the factory floor. In other words, it was the voice of my sister, my wife, my mother, my friend. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Needless to say, it is her speech that prompts the women to redouble their efforts until they have exceeded their quota. But more important, when the film is premiered, there is a round-faced fellow with a receding hairline in the fifteenth row who’d once held Anna in awe; and while he’d only been the director of the Moscow Department of Cinematographic Arts when he had the pleasure of meeting her in the Shalyapin back in 1923, he was now a senior official in the Ministry of Culture and rumored to be the likely successor to its current chief. So moved was he by her speech in the factory that he would soon be asking every director within earshot whether they hadn’t seen her astounding performance; and whenever she was in Moscow, he would send an arrangement of lilies to her room. . . . </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">Ah</i>, you may say with a knowing smile.  <i class="calibre3">So that is how it happened. That</i> <i class="calibre3">is how she regained her footing. . . . </i> But Anna Urbanova was a genuine artist trained on the stage. What is more, as a member of the Confederacy of the Humbled, she had become an actress who appeared on time, knew her lines, and never complained. And as official preference shifted toward movies with a sense of realism and a spirit of perseverance, there was often a role for a woman with seasoned beauty and a husky voice. In other words, there were many factors within and without Anna’s control that contributed to her resurgence. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Perhaps you are still skeptical. Well then, what about you? </p>
<p class="calibre1">No doubt there have been moments when your life has taken a bit of a leap forward; and no doubt you look back upon those moments with self-assurance and pride. But was there really no third party deserving of even a modicum of credit? Some mentor, family friend, or schoolmate who gave timely advice, made an introduction, or put in a complimentary word? </p>
<p class="calibre1">So, let us not dissect the hows and whys. It is enough to know that Anna Urbanova was once again a star with a house on the Fontanka Canal and copper ovals nailed to her furniture; though now when she has guests, she greets them at the door. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p197"/>Suddenly, at 4:45 in the afternoon, wheeling before the Count was the five-starred constellation of Delphinus. </p>
<p class="calibre1">If one drew a line with one’s finger through its two lowest stars and followed its trajectory across the heavens, one would reach Aquila, the Eagle; while if one drew a line through its uppermost stars, one would reach Pegasus, Bellerophon’s flying stallion; and if one drew a line in the opposite direction, one would reach what appeared to be a brand-new star—a sun that may have flared out a thousand years ago, but the light of which had just reached the Northern Hemisphere in order to provide guidance to weary travelers, sojourners, and adventurers for another millennia to come. . . . </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What are you doing?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Anna rolled back toward the Count. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I think you have a new freckle,” he said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Anna tried to look over her own shoulder. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Don’t worry,” he assured. “It’s nice.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Where is it?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“A few degrees east of Delphinus.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Delphinus?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You know. The constellation of the dolphin. You have it between your shoulder blades.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“How many freckles do I have?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“How many stars are in the sky . . . ?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Good God.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Anna rolled flat on her back. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The Count lit a cigarette and took a puff. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Don’t you know the story of Delphinus?” he asked, handing her the cigarette. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Why would I know the story of Delphinus?” she replied with a sigh. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“As a fisherman’s daughter.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">. . . </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Why don’t you tell it to me.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“All right. There was a wealthy poet named Arion. A great player of the lyre and the inventor of the dithyramb.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The dithyramb?” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p198"/>“An ancient type of verse. Anyway, one day he was returning from the island of Sicily when his crew decided to relieve him of his fortune. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Specifically, they gave him the option of killing himself or being thrown into the sea. As Arion weighed these unattractive alternatives, he sang a sorrowful song; and so beautiful was his singing, that a pod of dolphins gathered around the ship; and when he finally leapt into the sea, one of the dolphins carried him safely to shore. As a reward, Apollo placed this charitable creature among the stars to shine for all eternity.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That’s lovely.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The Count nodded, retrieving the cigarette from Anna and rolling on his back. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It’s your turn,” he said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“My turn for what?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“To tell a tale of the sea.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I don’t know any tales of the sea.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh, come now. Your father must have told you one or two. There isn’t a fisherman in Christendom who doesn’t tell tales of the sea.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">. . . </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Sasha, I have a bit of a confession. . . .” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“A confession?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I wasn’t raised on the Black Sea.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But what about your father? And meeting him at dusk by the shore to mend his nets?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“My father was a peasant from Poltava.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">. . . </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But why would you fabricate such a ridiculous story?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I think I thought it would appeal to you.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You think you thought?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Exactly.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The Count reflected for a moment. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What about the deboning of the fish!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I worked in a tavern in Odessa after I ran away from home.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The Count shook his head. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“How dispiriting.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Anna rolled on her side to face the Count. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p199"/>“You told me that preposterous story about the apples of Nizhny Novgorod.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But that story’s true!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh, come on. Apples as big as cannonballs? In every color of the rainbow?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The Count was silent for a moment. Then he tamped out the cigarette in the ashtray on the bedside table. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I should be going,” he said, and began climbing out of bed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“All right,” she said, pulling him back. “I remember one.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“One what?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“A sea story.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He rolled his eyes. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No. I’m serious. It’s a story my grandmother used to tell me.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“A sea story.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“With a young adventurer, and a deserted island, and a fortune in gold . . .” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Begrudgingly, the Count lay back on the pillows and gestured for her to begin. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Once upon a time, Anna related, there was a rich merchant with a fleet of ships and three sons, the youngest of whom was rather small in stature. </p>
<p class="calibre1">One spring, the merchant gave his older sons ships laden down with furs, carpets, and fine linens, instructing one to sail east and one to sail west in search of new kingdoms with which to trade. When the youngest son asked where his boat was, the merchant and the older boys laughed. In the end, the merchant gave his youngest son a rickety sloop with raggedy sails, a toothless crew, and empty sacks for ballast. When the young man asked his father in which direction he should sail, the merchant replied that he should sail until the sun never set in December. </p>
<p class="calibre1">So the son sailed southward with his scurvy crew. After three times three months on the open seas, they reached a land where the sun never set in December. There, they landed on an island that appeared to have a mountain of snow, but which turned out to have a mountain of salt. Salt was so plentiful in his homeland that housewives cast it over their shoulders for good luck without a second thought. Nonetheless, the young man instructed his crew to fill the sacks in the hull with the salt, if for no other reason than to add to the ship’s ballast. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p200"/>Sailing truer and faster than before, they soon came upon a great kingdom. The king received the merchant’s son in his court and asked what he had to trade. The young man replied that he had a hull full of salt. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Remarking that he had never heard of it, the king wished him well and sent him on his way. Undaunted, the young man paid a visit to the king’s kitchens, where he discreetly sprinkled salt onto the mutton, into the soup, over the tomatoes, and into custard. </p>
<p class="calibre1">That night, the king was amazed at the flavor of his food. The mutton was better, the soup was better, the tomatoes were better, even the custard was better. Calling his chefs before him, he excitedly asked what new technique they were using. Befuddled, the chefs admitted they had done nothing different; although they had been visited in the kitchen by the young stranger from the sea. . . . </p>
<p class="calibre1">The next afternoon, the merchant’s son set sail for home in a ship laden with one bag of gold for every sack of salt. </p>
<p class="calibre1">. . . </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Your grandmother told you that?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“She did.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">. . . </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It is a good story. . . .” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes, it is.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">. . . </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But it doesn’t absolve you.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I should think not.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p201"/> <i class="calibre3"><b class="calibre4">An Alliance</b></i></p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre4">A</b>t 5:45, with his five waiters standing at their stations, the Count made his nightly rounds of the Boyarsky. Beginning in the northwest corner, he circulated through the twenty tables to ensure that every setting, every saltcellar, every vase of flowers was in its proper place. </p>
<p class="calibre1">At table four a knife was realigned to be parallel with its fork. At table five a water glass was moved from midnight to one o’clock. At table six a wine glass that had a remnant of lipstick was whisked away, while at table seven the soap spots on a spoon were polished until the inverted image of the room could be clearly seen on the surface of the silver. </p>
<p class="calibre1">This, one might be inclined to observe, is exactly how Napoleon must have appeared when in the hour before dawn he walked among his ranks, reviewing everything from the stores of munitions to the dress of the infantry—having learned from experience that victory on the field of battle begins with the shine on a boot. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But many of Napoleon’s greatest battles lasted only a day and were never to be fought again. . . . </p>
<p class="calibre1">As such, the more apt analogy might be that of Gorsky at the Bolshoi. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Having studied the intent of the composer, collaborated closely with his conductor, trained his dancers, overseen the design of the costumes and sets, Gorsky also walked his ranks in the minutes before battle. But once the curtain fell and the audience departed, there would be no parade along the Champs-Élysées. For in less than twenty-four hours, his ballerinas, musicians, and technicians would reassemble to execute the same performance to the same standard of perfection. Now  <i class="calibre3">that</i> was the life of the Boyarsky—a battle that must be waged with exacting precision while giving the impression of effortlessness, every single night of the year. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Confident that all was in order in the dining room, at 5:55 the Count turned his attention, if briefly, to Emile’s kitchen. Peering through the little round window in the door, the Count could see that the chef’s assistants</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p202"/><img src="index-202_1.jpg" class="calibre2"/></p>
<p class="calibre1">were standing at the ready in their freshly bleached coats; he could see that the sauces were simmering on the stovetop and the garnishes ready for plating. But what of that notorious misanthrope of a chef? With the opening of the Boyarsky’s doors just minutes away, wasn’t he railing against his staff, his customers, and all his fellow men? </p>
<p class="calibre1">In point of fact, Emile Zhukovsky began his days in a state of the blackest pessimism. The very moment he looked out from under his covers, he met existence with a scowl, knowing it to be a cold and unforgiving condition. Having had his worst suspicions confirmed by the morning papers, at eleven o’clock he would be waiting at the curb for a crowded tram to rattle him to the hotel while muttering, “What a world.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">But as the day unfolded, hour by hour Emile’s pessimism would slowly give way to the possibility that all was not lost. This rosier perspective would begin building quietly around noon, when he came into his kitchen and saw his copper pots. Hanging from their hooks, still shining from the previous night’s scrubbing, they seemed to suggest an indisputable sense of possibility. Stepping into the cooler, he would hoist a side of lamb over his shoulder, and when he dropped it on the counter with a satisfying thump, his worldview would brighten by another hundred lumens. Such that by 3:00, when he heard the sound of root vegetables being chopped and smelled the aroma of garlic being sizzled, Emile might begrudgingly acknowledge that existence had its consolations. Then at 5:30, if everything seemed in order, he might allow himself to sample the wine that he’d been cooking with—just to polish off the bottle, you understand; waste not want not; neither a borrower nor a lender be. And at around 6:25, that dark humor which had seemed at dawn to be the very foundation of Emile’s soul, would become irreversibly sanguine when the first order was delivered to his kitchen. </p>
<p class="calibre1">So, what did the Count see when he looked through the window at 5:55? </p>
<p class="calibre1">He saw Emile dip a spoon into a bowl of chocolate mousse and lick it clean. </p>
<p class="calibre1">With that confirmation, the Count turned to Andrey and nodded. Then he assumed his station between table one and table two as the maître d’ threw the bolts to open the Boyarsky’s doors. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p203"/><img src="index-203_1.jpg" class="calibre2"/></p>
<p class="calibre1">Around nine o’clock, the Count reviewed the restaurant from corner to corner, satisfied that the first seating had gone without a hitch. Menus had been delivered and orders taken according to plan. Four inclinations toward overcooked lamb had been narrowly averted, more than five bottles of Latour had been poured, and the two members of the Politburo had been equitably seated and equitably served. But then Andrey (who had just led the Commissar of Transport to the opposite side of the room from the American journalists) signaled the Count with an expression of apparent distress. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What has happened?” asked the Count when he reached the maître d’s side. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I have just been notified that there is to be a private function in the Yellow Room, after all.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“How large?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“They weren’t specific, other than to say it would be small.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Then we can send Vasenka. I’ll take tables five and six; Maxim can take tables seven and eight.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But that’s just it,” said Andrey. “We cannot send Vasenka.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Why not?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Because they have asked for you by name.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Standing at attention in front of the Yellow Room was a Goliath that would have given any David pause. As the Count approached, the giant barely seemed to take note of his surroundings; then without a sign of acknowledgment, he suddenly stepped aside and deftly opened the door. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It was not particularly surprising for the Count to find a giant at the door of a private function in the Metropol; what was surprising was how the dining room had been arranged within. For the majority of furniture had been cleared to the periphery, leaving a single table set for two under the chandelier—at which a middle-aged man in a dark gray suit sat alone. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Though much smaller than the guard at the door and substantially better dressed, the man at the table struck the Count as one who was no stranger to brute force. His neck and wrists were as thick as a wrestler’s and his close-cropped hair revealed a scar above the left ear, which was presumably the</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p204"/>result of a glancing blow that had hoped to cleave his skull. Apparently unhurried, the man was playing with his spoon. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Good evening,” said the Count with a bow. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Good evening,” replied the man with a smile, returning his spoon to the table. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“May I bring you something to drink while you wait?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“There will be no one else coming.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Ah,” said the Count. He began clearing the second place setting. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You needn’t clear those.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’m sorry. I thought you weren’t expecting anyone else.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I am not expecting anyone else. I am expecting you, Alexander Ilyich.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The two men studied each other for a moment. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Please,” said the man. “Have a seat.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The Count hesitated to take the offered chair. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Under the circumstances, one might leap to the conclusion that the Count hesitated due to a suspicion or even dread about this stranger. But principally, he hesitated because as a matter of decorum, it seemed utterly inappropriate for one to sit at a table when one is dressed to wait upon it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Come now,” the stranger said amiably. “You wouldn’t refuse a solitary diner the pleasure of your company.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Certainly not,” replied the Count. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But having accepted the chair, he did not place the napkin in his lap. </p>
<p class="calibre1">After a rap at the door, it opened to admit the Goliath. Without looking at the Count, he approached the table and held out a bottle for the stranger’s consideration. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The host leaned forward and squinted at the label. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Excellent,” he said. “Thank you, Vladimir.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Presumably, Vladimir could simply have broken the top off the bottle, but with surprising agility he produced a corkscrew from a pocket, spun it in his hand, and pulled the cork. Then, having received a nod from his superior, he placed the open bottle on the table and retreated back to the hall. The stranger poured a glass for himself. Then, with the bottle hovering over the table at a forty-five-degree angle, he looked to the Count. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Won’t you join me?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“With pleasure.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">After the stranger poured, they both raised their glasses and drank. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p205"/>“Count Alexander Ilyich Rostov,” he said after returning his glass to the table. “Recipient of the Order of Saint Andrew, member of the Jockey Club, Master of the Hunt . . .” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You have me at a disadvantage.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You don’t know who I am?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I know that you are a man who can secure one of the Boyarsky’s private rooms in which to dine alone while a behemoth waits at the door.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The stranger laughed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Very good,” he said, leaning back in his chair. “What else do you see?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The Count studied his host more indiscreetly and then shrugged. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’d say you were a man of forty and were a soldier once. I suspect you joined the infantry, but were a colonel by the end of the war.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“How would you know that I became a colonel?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It is the business of a gentleman to distinguish between men of rank.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The business of a gentleman,” the colonel repeated with a smile, as if he appreciated the turn of phrase. “And can you tell where I’m from?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The Count dismissed the question with a wave of the hand. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The surest way to insult a Walloon is to mistake him for a Frenchman, though they live but a few miles apart and share the same language.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I suppose that’s true,” the colonel conceded. “Nonetheless. I’m interested in your guesswork; and I promise I won’t be insulted.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The Count took a sip of his wine and returned the glass to the table. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You are almost certainly from eastern Georgia.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The captain sat up with an expression of enthusiasm. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Extraordinary. Do I have an accent?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Not that’s distinguishable. But then armies, like universities, are where accents are most commonly shed.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Then why eastern Georgia?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The Count gestured to the wine. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Only an eastern Georgian would start his meal with a bottle of Rkatsiteli.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Because he’s a hayseed?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Because he misses home.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The colonel laughed again. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What a canny fellow you are.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p206"/>There was another rap at the door and it opened to admit the giant pushing a Regency cart. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Ah. Excellent. Here we are.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">When Vladimir had wheeled the cart to the table, the Count began to push back his chair, but his host gestured that he should remain seated. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Vladimir removed the dome and placed a platter at the center of the table. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As he left the room, the colonel picked up a carving knife and fork. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Let’s see. What do we have here? Ah, roasted duck. I’ve been told the Boyarsky’s is unparalleled.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You are not misinformed. Make sure you take a few cherries and some of the skin.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The colonel doled out a portion for himself, including cherries and skin, and then served the Count. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Absolutely delicious,” he said, when he had taken his first bite. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The Count bowed his head to accept the compliment on Emile’s behalf. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The colonel gestured to the Count with his fork. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You have a very interesting file, Alexander Ilyich.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I have a file?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’m sorry. A terrible habit of speech. What I meant to say is that you have an interesting  <i class="calibre3">background</i>.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Ah, yes. Well. Life has been generous to me in its variety.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The colonel smiled. Then he commenced in the tone of one who is trying to do justice to the facts. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You were born in Leningrad. . . .” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I was born in St. Petersburg.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Ah, yes, of course. In St. Petersburg. As your parents died when you were young, you were raised by your grandmother. You attended the academy and then the Imperial University in . . .  <i class="calibre3">St. Petersburg</i>.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“All correct.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“And you have traveled broadly, I gather.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The Count shrugged. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Paris. London. Firenze.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But when you last left the country in 1914, you went to France?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“On the sixteenth of May.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That’s right. A few days after the incident with Lieutenant Pulonov. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Tell me, why did you shoot the fellow? Wasn’t he an aristocrat like</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p207"/>yourself?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The Count showed an expression of mild shock. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I shot him  <i class="calibre3">because</i> he was an aristocrat.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The colonel laughed and waved his fork again. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I hadn’t thought of it that way. But yes, that’s an idea that we Bolsheviks should understand. So you were in Paris at the time of the Revolution, and shortly thereafter you made your way home.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Exactly.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Now, I think I understand why you hurried back: to help your grandmother safely from the country. But having arranged for her escape, why did you choose to stay?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“For the cuisine.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No, I am serious.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">. . . </p>
<p class="calibre1">“My days of leaving Russia were behind me.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But you didn’t take up arms with the Whites.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“And you don’t strike me as a coward. . . .” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I should hope not.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“So why didn’t you join in the fray?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The Count paused, then shrugged. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“When I left for Paris in 1914, I swore I would never shoot another one of my countrymen.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“And you count the Bolsheviks as your countrymen.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Of course I do.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Do you count them as gentlemen?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That’s another thing entirely. But certainly some of them are.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I see. But even from the manner in which you say that, I can tell that you do not count  <i class="calibre3">me</i> a gentleman. Now, why is that?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The Count responded with a light laugh, as much as to say that no gentleman would ever answer such a question. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Come now,” the colonel persisted. “Here we two are dining together on the Boyarsky’s roasted duck with a bottle of Georgian wine, which practically makes us old friends. And I am genuinely interested. What is it about me that makes you so sure that I am not a gentleman?” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p208"/>As a sign of encouragement, the colonel leaned across the table to refill the Count’s glass. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It isn’t any one thing,” the Count said after a moment. “It is an assembly of small details.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Like in a mosaic.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes. Like in a mosaic.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“So, give me an example of one of these smaller details.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The Count took a sip from his glass and replaced it on the table at one o’clock. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“As a host, it was perfectly appropriate for you to take up the serving tools. But a gentleman would have served his guest before he served himself.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The colonel, who had just taken a bite of duck, smiled at the Count’s first example and waved his fork. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Continue,” he said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“A gentleman wouldn’t gesture at another man with his fork,” said the Count, “or speak with his mouth full. But perhaps most importantly, he would have introduced himself at the beginning of a conversation—</p>
<p class="calibre1">particularly when he had the advantage over his guest.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The colonel put his utensils down. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“And I ordered the wrong wine,” he added with a smile. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The Count put a finger in the air. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No. There are many reasons for ordering a particular bottle of wine. </p>
<p class="calibre1">And memories of home are among the best.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Then allow me to introduce myself: I am Osip Ivanovich Glebnikov—</p>
<p class="calibre1">former colonel of the Red Army and an officer of the Party, who as a boy in eastern Georgia dreamed of Moscow, and who as a man of thirty-nine in Moscow dreams of eastern Georgia.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It is a pleasure meeting you,” said the Count, reaching across the table. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The two men shook hands and then resumed eating. After a moment, the Count ventured:</p>
<p class="calibre1">“If I may be so bold, Osip Ivanovich: What is it exactly that you  <i class="calibre3">do</i> as an officer of the Party?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Let’s just say that I am charged with keeping track of certain men of interest.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p209"/>“Ah. Well, I imagine that becomes rather easy to achieve when you place them under house arrest.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Actually,” corrected Glebnikov, “it is easier to achieve when you place them in the ground. . . .” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The Count conceded the point. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But by all accounts,” continued Glebnikov, “you seem to have reconciled yourself to your situation.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“As both a student of history and a man devoted to living in the present, I admit that I do not spend a lot of time imagining how things might otherwise have been. But I do like to think there is a difference between being resigned to a situation and reconciled to it.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Glebnikov let out a laugh and gave the table a light slap. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“There you go. That’s just the sort of nuance that has brought me begging to your door.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Setting his silverware down, the Count looked to his host with interest. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“As a nation, Alexander Ilyich, we are at a very interesting juncture. We have had open diplomatic relations with the French and British for seven years, and there is talk that we will soon have them with the Americans. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Since the time of Peter the Great, we have acted the poor cousin of the West</p>
<p class="calibre1">—admiring their ideas as much as we admired their clothes. But we are about to assume a very different role. Within a matter of years, we will be exporting more grain and manufacturing more steel than any other country in Europe. And we are leaps ahead of them all in ideology. As a result, for the first time, we are on the verge of taking our rightful place on the world stage. And when we do so, it will behoove us to listen with care and speak with clarity.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You would like to learn French and English.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Osip raised his glass in confirmation. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes, sir. But I don’t simply want to learn the languages. I want to understand those who speak them. And most especially, I would like to understand their privileged classes—for that’s who remains at the helm. I would like to understand how they view the world; what they are likely to count as a moral imperative; what they would be prone to value and what to disdain. It’s a matter of developing certain diplomatic skills, if you will. But for a man in my position, it is best to foster one’s skills . . . discreetly.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“How do you propose that I help?” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p210"/>“Simple. Dine with me once a month in this very room. Speak with me in French and English. Share with me your impressions of Western societies. And in exchange . . .” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Glebnikov let his sentence trail off, not to imply the paucity of what he could do for the Count, but rather to suggest the abundance. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But the Count raised a hand to stay any talk of exchanges. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“If you are a customer of the Boyarsky, Osip Ivanovich, then I am already at your service.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p211"/> <i class="calibre3"><b class="calibre4">Absinthe</b></i></p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre4">A</b>s the Count approached the Shalyapin at 12:15, what emanated from this onetime chapel of prayer and reflection was a sound that would have been unthinkable ten years before. It was a sound characterized by fits of laughter, a mélange of languages, the bleat of a trumpet, and the clinking of glasses—in other words, the sound of gay abandon. </p>
<p class="calibre1">What development could have brought about such a transformation? In the case of the Shalyapin, there were three. The first was the rather breathless return of the American musical form known as jazz. Having squelched the craze on the grounds of its intrinsic decadence, in the mid-1920s the Bolsheviks had begun to countenance it again. This was presumably so that they could study more closely how a single idea can sweep the globe. Whatever the cause, here it was zipping and zinging and rat-a-tat-tatting on its little stage at the back of the room. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The second development was the return of foreign correspondents. In the aftermath of the Revolution, the Bolsheviks had ushered them straight to the door (along with divinities, doubts, and all the other troublemakers). </p>
<p class="calibre1">But correspondents are a wily bunch. Having stashed their typewriters, crossed the border, changed their clothes, and counted to ten, they began slipping back into the country one by one. So in 1928, the Foreign Press Office was opened anew on the top floor of a six-story walk-up conveniently located halfway between the Kremlin and the offices of the secret police—a spot that just happened to be across the street from the Metropol. Thus, on any given night you could now find fifteen members of the international press in the Shalyapin ready to bend your ear. And when there were no listeners to be found, they lined up at the bar like gulls on the rocks and squawked all at once. </p>
<p class="calibre1">And then there was that extraordinary development of 1929. In April of that year, the Shalyapin suddenly had not one, not two, but three hostesses</p>
<p class="calibre1">—all young, beautiful, and wearing black dresses hemmed above the knee. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p212"/>With what charm and elegance they moved among the patrons of the bar, gracing the air with their slender silhouettes, delicate laughter, and hints of perfume. If the correspondents at the bar were inclined to talk more than they listened, in an instance of perfect symbiosis the hostesses were inclined to listen more than they talked. In part, of course, this was because their jobs depended upon it. For once a week, they were required to visit a little gray building on the corner of Dzerzhinsky Street where some little gray fellow behind a little gray desk would record whatever they had happened to hear word for word. <a href="index_split_006.html#p460">*</a></p>
<p class="calibre1">Did this obligation of the hostesses cause the journalists to be more cautious or tight-lipped for fear that some careless remark would be passed along? </p>
<p class="calibre1">On the contrary. The foreign press corps had a standing wager of ten American dollars to any of their number who could get summoned to the Commissariat of Internal Affairs. To that end, they crafted outrageous provocations and wove them into their chatter. One American let slip that in the backyard of a certain dacha a disenchanted engineer was building a balloon from specifications he’d found in Jules Verne. . . . Another relayed that an unnamed biologist was crossing a peep of chickens with a flock of pigeons to breed a bird that could lay an egg in the morning and deliver a message at night. . . . In sum, they would say anything within earshot of the hostesses—that is, anything that might be underscored in a report and land with a thud on a desk in the Kremlin. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As the Count stood at the Shalyapin’s entrance, he could see that tonight there was even more cavorting than usual. The jazz ensemble in the corner, which was charged with setting the tempo, was scrambling to keep up with the eruptions of laughter and the slaps on the back. Working his way through the hubbub, the Count approached the more discreet end of the bar (where an alabaster pillar fell from the ceiling to the floor). A moment later, Audrius was leaning toward the Count with his forearm on the bar. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Good evening, Count Rostov.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Good evening, Audrius. It seems like quite a celebration tonight.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The bartender gestured with his head toward one of the Americans. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Mr. Lyons was taken to the office of the OGPU today.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The OGPU! How so?” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p213"/>“It seems that a letter written in his hand was found on the floor of Perlov’s Tea House—a letter that included descriptions of troop movements and artillery placements on the outskirts of Smolensk. But when the letter was laid on the desk and Mr. Lyons was asked to explain himself, he said that he’d simply been transcribing his favorite passage from  <i class="calibre3">War and</i> <i class="calibre3">Peace</i>.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Ah, yes,” said the Count with a smile. “The Battle of Borodino.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“For this accomplishment, he collected the kitty and now he’s buying everyone a round. But what can we do for you this evening?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The Count tapped twice on the bar. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You wouldn’t happen to have any absinthe, would you?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ever so slightly, Audrius raised an eyebrow. </p>
<p class="calibre1">How well this tender of bar knew the Count’s preferences. He knew that before dinner the Count enjoyed a glass of champagne or dry vermouth. He knew that after dinner he enjoyed a snifter of brandy until the average nightly temperature fell below 40˚, at which point he would switch to a glass of whiskey or port. But absinthe? In the decade that they had known each other, the Count had not asked for a single glass. In fact, he rarely indulged in any of the syrupy liqueurs—and certainly not those that were colored green and reported to cause madness. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But ever the professional, Audrius confined his surprise to the movement of his eyebrow. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I believe I may have one bottle left,” he said. Then opening a seamless door in the wall, he disappeared into the cabinet where he kept his more expensive and esoteric spirits. </p>
<p class="calibre1">On the platform in the opposite corner of the bar, the jazz ensemble was playing a perky little tune. Admittedly, when the Count had first encountered jazz, he hadn’t much of an affinity for it. He had been raised to appreciate music of sentiment and nuance, music that rewarded patience and attention with crescendos and diminuendos, allegros and adagios artfully arranged over four whole movements—not a fistful of notes crammed higgledy-piggledy into thirty measures. </p>
<p class="calibre1">And yet . . . </p>
<p class="calibre1">And yet, the art form had grown on him. Like the American correspondents, jazz seemed a naturally gregarious force—one that was a little unruly and prone to say the first thing that popped into its head, but</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p214"/><img src="index-214_1.jpg" class="calibre2"/></p>
<p class="calibre1">generally of good humor and friendly intent. In addition, it seemed decidedly unconcerned with where it had been or where it was going—</p>
<p class="calibre1">exhibiting somehow simultaneously the confidence of the master and the inexperience of the apprentice. Was there any wonder that such an art had failed to originate in Europe? </p>
<p class="calibre1">The Count’s reverie was broken by the sound of a bottle being placed on the bar. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Absinthe Robette,” said Audrius, tilting the bottle so that the Count could read the label. “But I’m afraid there’s only an ounce or two left.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It will have to do.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The bartender emptied the bottle into a cordial glass. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Thank you, Audrius. Please add it to my account.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No need. It is on Mr. Lyons.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">As the Count turned to go, an American who had commandeered the piano began performing a jaunty little number that celebrated a lack of bananas, a lack of bananas today. A moment later, all the journalists were singing along. On another night, the Count might have lingered to observe the festivities, but he had his own celebration to attend to. So with his precious cargo in hand, he navigated through the crowd of elbows, being careful not to spill a drop. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Yes, thought the Count as he climbed the stairs to the second floor, this evening the Triumvirate has its own cause for celebration. . . . </p>
<p class="calibre1">The Plan had been hatched almost three years before, springing from a wistful comment of Andrey’s, which had been echoed by Emile. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Sadly, it’s impossible,” the maître d’ had lamented. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes,” the chef had conceded with a shake of the head. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But was it? </p>
<p class="calibre1">All told, there were fifteen ingredients. Six of them could be plucked from the pantry of the Boyarsky at any time of year. Another five were readily available in season. The nut of the problem was that, despite the overall improvement in the general availability of goods, the last four ingredients remained relatively rare. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p215"/>From the outset, it was agreed that there would be no skimping—no shortcuts or substitutions. It was the symphony or silence. So the Triumvirate would have to be patient and watchful. They would have to be willing to beg, barter, collude, and if necessary, resort to chicanery. Three times the dream had been within their grasp, only to be snatched away at the last moment by unforeseen circumstances (once by mishap, once by mold, and once by mice). </p>
<p class="calibre1">But earlier that week, it seemed that the stars were wheeling into alignment once again. With nine elements already in Emile’s kitchen, four whole haddock and a basket of mussels meant for the National Hotel had been delivered to the Metropol by mistake. That was ten and eleven in a single stroke. The Triumvirate convened and conferred. A favor could be called in by Andrey, a swap negotiated by Emile, and Audrius approached by the Count. Thus, the twelfth, thirteenth, and fourteenth ingredients. But the fifteenth? This would require access to a store with the rarest of luxuries</p>
<p class="calibre1">—that is, one which served the highest members of the Party. A discreet inquiry was made by the Count of a certain actress with certain connections. </p>
<p class="calibre1">And  <i class="calibre3">mirabile dictu</i>, an unsigned envelope had been slipped under his door. </p>
<p class="calibre1">With all fifteen ingredients now at hand, the Triumvirate’s patience was on the verge of being rewarded. Within the hour, they would once again experience that intricacy of flavors, that divine distillation, that impression as rich and elusive as—</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Good evening, comrade.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The Count stopped in his tracks. </p>
<p class="calibre1">For a moment he hesitated. Then he slowly turned around—as from the shadows of an alcove the hotel’s assistant manager emerged. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Like his counterpart on the chessboard, the Bishop of the Metropol never moved along the rank or file. With him it was always on the bias: slipping diagonally from corner to corner, skirting past a potted plant, sliding through a crack in the door. One caught sight of him at the periphery of one’s vision, if one caught sight of him at all. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Good evening,” replied the Count. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The two men took each other in from heel to hair—both practiced at confirming in a glance their worst suspicions of each other. Leaning a little to his right, the Bishop adopted an expression of idle curiosity. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What do we have here . . . ?” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p216"/>“What do we have where?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Why, there. Behind your back.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Behind my back?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The Count slowly brought his hands in front of him and turned his palms upright to show that they were empty. The right upper corner of the Bishop’s smile twitched, turning it ever so briefly into a smirk. The Count reciprocated in kind and with a polite bow of the head turned to walk away. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Headed to the Boyarsky . . . ?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The Count stopped and turned back. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes. That’s right. The Boyarsky.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Isn’t it closed . . . ?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It is. But I think I may have left my pen in Emile’s office.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Ah. The man of letters has lost his pen.  <i class="calibre3">Where is it now . . . , </i> hmm? If not in the kitchen, perhaps you should look in the blue pagoda of your fine Chinoiserie.” And turning with his smirk, the Bishop slipped diagonally down the hall. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The Count waited until he was out of sight, then hurried in the opposite direction, muttering as he went:</p>
<p class="calibre1">“<i class="calibre3">Where is it now . . . ? Perhaps in your blue pagoda. . . . </i> Very witty, I’m sure. Coming from a man who couldn’t rhyme  <i class="calibre3">cow</i> with  <i class="calibre3">plow</i>. And what’s with all that dot-dot-dotting?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ever since the Bishop had been promoted, he had taken to adding an ellipsis at the end of every question. But what was one to infer from it . . . ? </p>
<p class="calibre1">That this particular punctuation mark should be fended off . . . ? That an interrogative sentence should never end . . . ? That even though he is asking a question, he has no need of an answer because he has already formed an opinion . . . ? </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">Of course. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">Coming through the Boyarsky’s doors, which Andrey had left unbolted, the Count crossed the empty dining room and passed through the swinging door into the kitchen. There he found the chef at his counter slicing a bulb of fennel, as four stalks of celery lying in an orderly row waited like Spartans to meet their fate. To the side were the filets of haddock and the basket of mussels, while on the stove sat a great copper pot from which small clouds of steam graced the air with other intimations of the sea. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p217"/>Looking up from the fennel, Emile met the eye of the Count and smiled. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In an instant the Count could see that the chef was in rosy form. Having sensed at two that all might not be lost, at half past midnight the chef hadn’t the slightest doubt that the sun would shine tomorrow, that most people were generous at heart, and that, when all was said and done, things tended to work out for the best. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The chef wasted no time on salutations. Instead, without pausing his chopper, he tilted his head toward the little table, which had been moved from his office into the kitchen and which had been waiting patiently to be set. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But first things first. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Carefully, the Count removed the little cordial glass from his back pocket and placed it on the counter. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Ah,” said the chef, wiping his hands on his apron. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Is it enough?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It is only meant to be a hint. An aside. An innuendo. If it is the real thing, it should be plenty.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Emile dipped his pinkie in the absinthe and gave it a lick. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Perfect,” he said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Selecting an appropriate tablecloth from the linen closet, the Count unfurled it with a snap and let it billow to the table. As he set the places, the chef began to whistle a tune and the Count smiled to realize it was the very same song that he had heard in the Shalyapin regarding the absence of bananas. As if on cue, the door to the back stair opened and in rushed Andrey with a pile of oranges about to tumble from his arms. Reaching Emile’s side, he bowed at the waist and spilled them onto the counter. </p>
<p class="calibre1">With the instincts of convicts who discover the gates of their prison open, the individual oranges rolled in every direction to maximize their chances of escape. In a flash, Andrey had extended his arms in a grand circumference to fence them in. But one of the oranges dodged the maître d’s reach and shot across the counter—headed straight for the absinthe! </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dropping his chopper, Emile lunged and plucked the glass from the counter in the nick of time. The orange, which was gaining in confidence, dashed behind the fennel, jumped from the counter, thudded to the floor, and made a break for the exit. But at the last moment, that door that separated Emile’s kitchen from the rest of the world swung inward, sending the orange</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p218"/>spinning back across the floor in the opposite direction—while in the doorway stood the Bishop. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The three members of the Triumvirate froze. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Advancing two paces north by northwest, the Bishop took in the scene. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Good evening, gentlemen,” he said in his friendliest tone. “What brings you all to the kitchen at this hour . . . ?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Andrey, who’d had the presence of mind to step in front of the simmering pot, gestured with a hand toward the food on the counter. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We are taking inventory.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Inventory . . . ?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes. Our quarterly inventory.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Of course,” the Bishop replied with his ecclesiastical smile. “And at whose request are you taking a quarterly inventory . . . ?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">As this exchange between the Bishop and the maître d’ unfolded, the Count noticed that Emile, who had grown pale at the inward swinging of the door, was regaining his color second by second. It had begun with a slight pinkness of the cheeks when the Bishop had crossed the threshold. It turned to rose when the Bishop asked  <i class="calibre3">What brings you all to the</i> <i class="calibre3">kitchen . . . ? </i> But when he asked  <i class="calibre3">At whose request . . . ? </i> the chef’s cheeks, neck, and ears took on a purple of such moral indignation, it made one wonder if the presence of a question mark in his kitchen was itself a capital crime. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“At whose request?” the chef asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The Bishop turned his gaze from Andrey to Emile and was clearly struck by the chef’s transformation. He seemed to waver. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“At whose request?” the chef repeated. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Without taking his eyes off the Bishop, Emile suddenly reached for his chopper. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“At whose request!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">When Emile took a step forward while raising his chopping arm high above his head, the Bishop grew as white as the haddock. Then the kitchen door was swinging on its hinge and the Bishop was nowhere to be seen. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Andrey and the Count turned their gaze from the door to Emile. Then in wide-eyed amazement, Andrey pointed a delicate finger at Emile’s raised hand. For in the heat of outrage, the chef had grabbed not his chopper but a</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p219"/><img src="index-219_1.jpg" class="calibre2"/></p>
<p class="calibre1"><img src="index-219_2.jpg" class="calibre2"/></p>
<p class="calibre1">celery stalk, whose little green fronds now trembled in the air. And to a man, the Triumvirate burst into laughter. </p>
<p class="calibre1">At one in the morning, the conspirators took their seats. On the table before them were a single candle, a loaf of bread, a bottle of rosé, and three bowls of bouillabaisse. </p>
<p class="calibre1">After exchanging a glance, the three men dipped their spoons into the stew in unison, but for Emile, the gesture was a sleight of hand. For when Andrey and the Count raised their spoons to their mouths, Emile let his hover above his bowl <i class="calibre3">—</i> intent upon studying his friends’ expressions at the very first taste. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Fully aware that he was being watched, the Count closed his eyes to attend more closely to his impressions. </p>
<p class="calibre1">How to describe it? </p>
<p class="calibre1">One first tastes the broth—that simmered distillation of fish bones, fennel, and tomatoes, with their hearty suggestions of Provence. One then savors the tender flakes of haddock and the briny resilience of the mussels, which have been purchased on the docks from the fisherman. One marvels at the boldness of the oranges arriving from Spain and the absinthe poured in the taverns. And all of these various impressions are somehow collected, composed, and brightened by the saffron—that essence of summer sun which, having been harvested in the hills of Greece and packed by mule to Athens, has been sailed across the Mediterranean in a felucca. In other words, with the very first spoonful one finds oneself transported to the port of Marseille—where the streets teem with sailors, thieves, and madonnas, with sunlight and summer, with languages and life. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The Count opened his eyes. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“<i class="calibre3">Magnifique</i>,” he said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Andrey, who had put down his spoon, brought his elegant hands together in a respectful show of silent applause. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Beaming, the chef bowed to his friends and then joined them in their long-awaited meal. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p220"/>Over the next two hours, the three members of the Triumvirate each ate three bowls of the bouillabaisse, each drank a bottle of wine, and each spoke openly in turn. </p>
<p class="calibre1">And what did these old friends talk about? What did they  <i class="calibre3">not</i> talk about! </p>
<p class="calibre1">They talked of their childhoods in St. Petersburg, Minsk, and Lyon. Of their first and second loves. Of Andrey’s four-year-old son and Emile’s four-year-old lumbago. They spoke of the once and the was, of the wishful and the wonderful. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Rarely awake at this hour, Emile was in an unprecedented state of euphoria. As youthful stories were told, he laughed so heartily that his head rolled on his shoulders, and the corner of his napkin was raised to his eyes twice as often as it was raised to his lips. </p>
<p class="calibre1">And the  <i class="calibre3">pièce de résistance</i>? At three in the morning, Andrey referred briefly, offhandedly, almost parenthetically to his days under the big top. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Eh? What’s that? Under what?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Did you say ‘the big top’?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Yes. In point of fact: the circus. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Raised by a widowed father who was prone to drunken violence, at the age of sixteen Andrey had run away to join a traveling circus. It was with this troupe that he had come to Moscow in 1913 where, having fallen in love with a bookseller in the Arbat, he had bid the circus  <i class="calibre3">adieu</i>. Two months later, he was hired as a waiter at the Boyarsky, and he had been there ever since. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What did you do in the circus?” asked the Count. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“An acrobat?” suggested Emile. “A clown?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“A lion tamer?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I juggled.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No,” said Emile. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In lieu of a response, the maître d’ rose from the table and gathered three of the unused oranges from the countertop. With the fruit in his hands, he stood perfectly erect. Or rather, he stood at a slight tilt induced by the wine, a sort of 12:02. Then after a brief pause, he set the spheres in motion. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In all honesty, the Count and Emile had been skeptical of their old friend’s claim; but as soon as he began, they could only wonder that they had not guessed at it before. For Andrey’s hands had been crafted by God to juggle. So deft was his touch that the oranges seemed to move of their own</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p221"/><img src="index-221_1.jpg" class="calibre2"/></p>
<p class="calibre1">accord. Or better yet, they moved like planets governed by a force of gravity that simultaneously propelled them forward and kept them from flinging off into space; while Andrey, who was standing before these planets, seemed to be simply plucking them from their orbits and releasing them a moment later to pursue their natural course. </p>
<p class="calibre1">So gentle and rhythmic was the motion of Andrey’s hands that one was at constant risk of falling under hypnosis. And, in fact, without Emile or the Count noticing, another orange had suddenly joined the solar system. And then with a courtly flourish, Andrey caught all four spheres and bowed at the waist. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Now it was the Count and Emile’s turn to applaud. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But surely, you didn’t juggle oranges,” said Emile. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No,” Andrey admitted, as he carefully returned the oranges to the counter. “I juggled knives.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Before the Count and Emile could express their disbelief, Andrey had taken three blades from a drawer and set them in motion. These were no planets. They spun through the air like the parts of some infernal machine, an effect that was heightened by the flashes of light from whenever the candle’s flame was reflected on the surface of the blades. And then, just as suddenly as the knives had been set in motion, their hilts were fixed in Andrey’s hands. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Ah, but can you do four of  <i class="calibre3">those</i>?” teased the Count. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Without a word, Andrey moved back toward the knife drawer; but before he could reach inside, Emile had risen to his feet. With the expression of a boy enthralled by a street magician, he shyly stepped from the crowd and held out his chopper—that blade which had not been touched by another human hand in almost fifteen years. With an appropriate sense of ceremony, Andrey bowed from the waist to accept it. And when he set the four knives in motion, Emile leaned back in his chair and with a tear in his eye watched as his trusted blade tumbled effortlessly through space, feeling that this moment, this hour, this universe could not be improved upon. </p>
<p class="calibre1">At half past three in the morning, the Count swayed up the stairs, veered to his room, lurched through his closet, emptied his pockets onto the</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p222"/>bookcase, poured himself a brandy, and with a sigh of satisfaction dropped into his chair. While from her place on the wall, Helena took him in with a tender, knowing smile. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes, yes,” he admitted. “It is a little late, and I am a little drunk. But in my defense, it has been an eventful day.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">As if to make his point, the Count suddenly rose from his chair and tugged at one of the folds of his jacket. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Do you see this button? I’ll have you know that I sewed it on myself.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Then dropping back in his chair, the Count picked up his brandy, took a sip, and reflected. “She was perfectly right, you know. Marina, I mean. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Absolutely, positively, perfectly right.” The Count sighed again. Then he shared with his sister a notion. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Since the beginning of storytelling, he explained, Death has called on the unwitting. In one tale or another, it arrives quietly in town and takes a room at an inn, or lurks in an alleyway, or lingers in the marketplace, surreptitiously. Then just when the hero has a moment of respite from his daily affairs, Death pays him a visit. </p>
<p class="calibre1">This is all well and good, allowed the Count. But what is rarely related is the fact that Life is every bit as devious as Death. It too can wear a hooded coat. It too can slip into town, lurk in an alley, or wait in the back of a tavern. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hadn’t it paid such a visit to Mishka? Hadn’t it found him hiding behind his books, lured him out of the library, and taken his hand on a secluded spot overlooking the Neva? </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hadn’t it found Andrey in Lyon and beckoned him to the big top? </p>
<p class="calibre1">Emptying his glass, the Count rose from his chair and stumbled into the bookcase as he reached for the brandy. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“<i class="calibre3">Excusez-moi</i>,  <i class="calibre3">monsieur</i>.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The Count poured himself a tad, just a drop, no more than a sip, and fell back into his seat. Then waving a finger gently in the air, he continued:</p>
<p class="calibre1">“The collectivization of collectives, Helena, and the dekulaking of kulaks—in all probability, these are quite probable. They’re even likely to be likely. But  <i class="calibre3">inevitable</i>?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">With a knowing smile, the Count shook his head at the very sound of the word. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p223"/><img src="index-223_1.jpg" class="calibre2"/></p>
<p class="calibre1"><img src="index-223_2.jpg" class="calibre2"/></p>
<p class="calibre1">“Allow me to tell you what is inevitable. What is inevitable is that Life will pay Nina a visit too. She may be as sober as St. Augustine, but she is too alert and too vibrant for Life to let her shake a hand and walk off alone. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Life will follow her in a taxi. It will bump into her by chance. It will work its way into her affections. And to do so, it will beg, barter, collude, and if necessary, resort to chicanery. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What a world,” the Count sighed at last, before falling asleep in his chair. </p>
<p class="calibre1">On the following morning, with his eyes a little blurry and his head a little sore, the Count poured a second cup of coffee, settled himself in his chair, and leaned to his side in order to retrieve Mishka’s letter from his jacket. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But it wasn’t there. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The Count distinctly remembered tucking the letter in the inside pocket when he was leaving the lobby the day before; and it had definitely been there when he had repaired the button in Marina’s office. . . . </p>
<p class="calibre1">It must have fallen out, he thought, when he draped the jacket over the back of Anna’s chair. So, after finishing his coffee, the Count went down to suite 311—only to find the door open, the closets empty, and the bottom of the dustbins bare. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But Mishka’s half-read letter had not fallen from the Count’s jacket in Anna’s room. Having emptied his pockets at half past three, when the Count had stumbled reaching for the brandy, he had knocked the letter into the gap between the bookcase and the wall, where it was destined to remain. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Though perhaps this was just as well. </p>
<p class="calibre1">For while the Count had been so moved by Mishka’s bittersweet walk along Nevsky Prospekt and his romantic lines of verse, the lines of verse were not written by Mishka at all. They were from the poem that Mayakovsky had delivered while standing on his chair back in 1923. And what had prompted Mishka to quote them had nothing to do with the day that Katerina had first taken his hand. What had prompted the citation, and the writing of the letter, for that matter, was the fact that on the fourteenth</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p224"/>of April, Vladimir Mayakovsky, the poet laureate of the Revolution, had shot himself through the heart with a prop revolver. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p225"/> <i class="calibre3"><b class="calibre4">Addendum</b></i></p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre4">O</b>n the morning of the twenty-second of June, even as the Count was looking through his pockets for Mishka’s letter, Nina Kulikova and her three confederates were boarding a train headed east for Ivanovo full of energy, excitement, and a clear sense of purpose. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Since the launch of the First Five-Year Plan in 1928, tens of thousands of their comrades in the urban centers had been working tirelessly to build power stations, steel mills, and manufacturing plants for heavy machinery. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As this historic effort unfolded, it would be essential for the country’s grain-producing regions to do their part—by meeting the increased demand for bread in the cities with leaps in agricultural production. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But to pave the way for this ambitious effort, it was deemed necessary to exile a million kulaks—those profiteers and enemies of the common good, who also happened to be the regions’ most capable farmers. The remaining peasants, who viewed newly introduced approaches to agriculture with resentment and suspicion, proved antagonistic to even the smallest efforts at innovation. Tractors, which were meant to usher in the new era by the fleet, ended up being in short supply. These challenges were compounded by uncooperative weather resulting in a collapse of agricultural output. But given the imperative of feeding the cities, the precipitous decline in the harvest was met with increased quotas and requisitions enforced at gunpoint. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In 1932, the combination of these intractable forces would result in widespread hardship for the agricultural provinces of old Russia, and death by starvation for millions of peasants in Ukraine. <a href="index_split_006.html#p461">*</a></p>
<p class="calibre1">But, as noted, all of this was still in the offing. And when Nina’s train finally arrived in the far reaches of Ivanovo, where the fields of young wheat bent in the breeze for as far as the eye could see, she was almost overwhelmed by the beauty of the landscape, and by the sense that her life had just begun. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p226"/><b class="calibre4">1938</b></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3"><b class="calibre4">An Arrival</b></i></p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre4">L</b>et us concede that the early thirties in Russia were unkind. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In addition to starvation in the countryside, the famine of ’32</p>
<p class="calibre1">eventually led to a migration of peasants to the cities, which, in turn, contributed to overcrowded housing, shortages of essential goods, even hooliganism. At the same time, the most stalwart workers in the urban centers were wearying under the burden of the continuous workweek; artists faced tighter constraints on what they could or could not imagine; churches were shuttered, repurposed, or razed; and when revolutionary hero Sergei Kirov was assassinated, the nation was purged of an array of politically unreliable elements. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But then, on the seventeenth of November 1935, at the First All-Union Conference of Stakhanovites, Stalin himself declared:  <i class="calibre3">Life has improved,</i> <i class="calibre3">comrades. Life is more joyous. . . . </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">Yes, generally speaking such a remark falling from the lips of a statesman should be swept from the floor with the dust and the lint. But when it fell from the lips of Soso, one had good reason to lend it credence. </p>
<p class="calibre1">For it was often through secondary remarks in secondary speeches that the General Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party signaled the shifts in his thinking. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In point of fact, a few days before giving this speech, Soso had seen a photograph in the  <i class="calibre3">Herald Tribune</i> of three healthy young Bolshevik girls standing before a factory gate—dressed in the tunic and kerchief long favored by the Party. Normally, such a picture would have warmed the cockles of his heart. But in the context of the Western press, it struck the Secretary of Secretaries that this simple attire might suggest to the world that after eighteen years of Communism, Russian girls still lived like</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p227"/>peasants. Thus, the fateful sentences were slipped into the speech—and the direction of the country veered. </p>
<p class="calibre1">For upon reading in  <i class="calibre3">Pravda</i> that life had improved, the attentive apparatchiks understood that a turning point had been reached—that given the Revolution’s unqualified success, the time had come for the Party not only to countenance but to encourage a little more glamour, a little more luxury, a little more laughter. Within a matter of weeks, the Christmas tree and Gypsy music, both long in exile, were given a warm welcome home; Polina Molotova, wife of the foreign minister, was entrusted with the launch of the first Soviet perfumes; the New Light Factory (with the help of some imported machinery) was charged with producing champagne at the rate of ten thousand bottles a day; members of the Politburo traded in their military uniforms for tailored suits; and those hardworking girls exiting their factories were now encouraged to look not like peasants, but like the</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a href="index_split_006.html#p462">girls along the Champs-Élysées.*</a></p>
<p class="calibre1">So, not unlike that fellow in Genesis who said  <i class="calibre3">Let there be this</i>, or <i class="calibre3"> Let</i> <i class="calibre3">there be that</i>, and there was this or that, when Soso said  <i class="calibre3">Life has improved,</i> <i class="calibre3">comrades</i>, life—in fact—improved! </p>
<p class="calibre1">Case in point: At this very moment, two young ladies are strolling down Kuznetsky Most wearing brightly colored dresses fitted at the waist and hemmed at the calf. One of them even sports a yellow hat with a brim that slopes seductively over a long-lashed eye. With the rumble of the brand-new Metro underfoot, they pause before three of the great windows at TsUM, the Central Universal Department Store, which respectively showcase a pyramid of hats, a pyramid of watches, and a pyramid of high-heeled shoes. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Granted, the girls still live in crowded apartments and wash their pretty dresses in a common sink, but do they look through the store’s windows with resentment? Not in the least. With envy, perhaps, or wide-eyed wonder, but not resentment. For the doors of TsUM are no longer closed to them. Having long served foreigners and high Party officials, the store had been opened to the citizenry in ’36—as long as they could pay the cashier in foreign currencies, silver, or gold. In fact, on TsUM’s lower level there is a nicely appointed office where a discreet gentleman will give you store credit for half the value of your grandmother’s jewelry. </p>
<p class="calibre1">You see? Life  <i class="calibre3">is</i> more joyous. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p228"/><img src="index-228_1.jpg" class="calibre2"/></p>
<p class="calibre1">So, having admired the contents of the windows and imagined the day when they too might have an apartment with closets in which to stow their hats, watches, and shoes, our fetching pair resumes their stroll, all the while chatting about the two well-connected young men they are on their way to meet for dinner. </p>
<p class="calibre1">At Teatralny Proyezd, they wait at the curb for a break in the flow of automobiles. Then skipping across the street, they enter the Metropol Hotel where, as they pass the concierge’s desk en route to the Piazza, they are admired by a distinguished-looking man with a touch of gray in his hair. . . . </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Ah, the end of spring,” observed the Count to Vasily (who was sorting through the night’s reservations). “By the hems of the skirts on those young ladies, I’d wager it must be almost 70˚ along Tverskaya, despite being seven o’clock at night. In another few days, the boys will be stealing posies from the Alexander Gardens and Emile will be scattering peas across his plates. . . .” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No doubt,” said the concierge, in the manner of a librarian agreeing with a scholar. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Earlier that day, in fact, the first strawberries of the season had arrived in the kitchen and Emile had slipped a handful to the Count for his breakfast the following morning. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Without question,” concluded the Count, “summer is now at the gates and the days that ensue are sure to be long and carefree. . . .” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Alexander Ilyich.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">At the unexpected sound of his own name, the Count turned to find another young lady standing right behind him, though this one was in a pair of pants. Five and a half feet tall, she had straight blond hair, light blue eyes, and a rare sense of self-possession. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Nina!” he exclaimed. “What a sight for sore eyes. We haven’t heard from you in ages. When did you get back to Moscow?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“May I speak with you a moment?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Certainly . . .” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Sensing that something personal must have prompted the visit, the Count followed Nina a few paces from the concierge’s desk. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p229"/>“It is my husband—” she began. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Your husband,” the Count interjected. “You’ve gotten married!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes,” she said. “Leo and I have been married for six years. We worked together in Ivanovo—” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Why, I remember him!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Frustrated by the Count’s interruptions, Nina shook her head. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You would not have met.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You’re quite right. We did not meet, per se; but he was here with you in the hotel just before you left.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The Count couldn’t help but smile to recall the handsome Komsomol captain who had sent the others on ahead so that he could wait for Nina alone. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nina tried for a moment to recollect this visit with her husband to the Metropol; but then waved a hand as if to say whether or not they had been in the hotel all those years ago was of no consequence. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Please, Alexander Ilyich. I don’t have much time. Two weeks ago, we were recalled from Ivanovo to attend a conference on the future of agricultural planning. On the first day of the meetings, Leo was arrested. </p>
<p class="calibre1">After some effort, I tracked him to the Lubyanka, but they wouldn’t let me see him. Naturally, I began to fear the worst. But yesterday, I received word that he has been sentenced to five years corrective labor. They are putting him on a train tonight for Sevvostlag. I’m going to follow him there. What I need is for someone to watch over Sofia while I get myself settled.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Sofia?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The Count followed Nina’s glance across the lobby to where a girl of five or six with black hair and ivory skin was in a high-back chair, her feet dangling a few inches from the floor. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I can’t take her with me now as I will need to find work and a place to live. It may take a month or two. But once I have established myself, I’ll come back for her.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nina had explained these developments as one reports a series of scientific outcomes—a succession of facts that warranted our fear and indignation as much as would the laws of gravity or motion. But the Count could no longer contain some sense of shock, if only due to the speed at which the particulars were unfolding: a husband, a daughter, an arrest, the Lubyanka, corrective labor . . . </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p230"/><img src="index-230_1.jpg" class="calibre2"/></p>
<p class="calibre1">Interpreting the Count’s expression as one of hesitation, Nina—that most self-reliant of souls—gripped the Count by the arm. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I have no one else to turn to, Alexander.” Then after a pause she added:</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Please.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Together, the Count and Nina crossed the lobby to this child of five or six with black hair, white skin, and dark blue eyes. Had the Count been introduced to Sofia under different circumstances, he might have observed with quiet amusement the signs of Nina’s rugged practicality on display: that Sofia wore simple clothes; that her hair was almost as short as a boy’s; and that the linen doll she hugged by the neck didn’t even have a dress. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nina knelt so that she could see her daughter eye to eye. She put a hand on Sofia’s knee and began to speak in a tenor the Count had never heard her speak in before. It was the tenor of tenderness. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Sonya, this is your Uncle Sasha whom I have told you so much about.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The one who gave you the pretty binoculars?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes,” said Nina with a smile. “The very same.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Hello, Sofia,” said the Count. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nina then explained that while Mama went to prepare their new home, Sofia would be staying for a few weeks in this lovely hotel. Nina told her that until Mama returned, she must be strong and respectful and listen to her uncle. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“And then we will take the long train to Papa,” the girl said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That’s right, my sweet. Then we will take the long train to Papa.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Sofia was doing her best to match her mother’s fortitude; but she did not yet have her mother’s command over her own emotions. So while she did not question, or plead, or act dismayed, when she nodded to show that she understood, tears fell down her cheeks. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nina used her thumb to wipe the tears away from one side of her daughter’s face as Sofia used the back of her hand to wipe them away from the other. Nina looked Sofia in the eye until she was sure the tears had stopped. Then nodding once, she gave her daughter a kiss on the forehead and led the Count a few yards away. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p231"/><img src="index-231_1.jpg" class="calibre2"/></p>
<p class="calibre1">“Here,” she said, handing him a canvas pack with shoulder straps, the sort that might have been worn on the back of a soldier. “These are her things. And you should probably take this too.” Nina handed him a small photograph without a frame. “It may be better to keep it to yourself. I don’t know. You will have to decide.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nina gripped the Count on the arm again; then she walked across the lobby at the pace of one who hopes to leave herself no room for second thoughts. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The Count watched her exit the hotel and head across Theatre Square, just as he had eight years before. When she was gone, he looked down at the photograph in his hand. It was a picture of Nina and her husband, Sofia’s father. From Nina’s face, the Count could tell that the picture had been taken some years before. He could also tell that he had only been half right. For while he had seen her husband all those years ago in the lobby of the Metropol, Nina had not married the handsome captain—she had married the hapless young fellow with the sailor’s cap who had so eagerly retrieved her coat. </p>
<p class="calibre1">This entire exchange—from Nina’s saying the Count’s name to her passing through the hotel’s doors—had taken less than fifteen minutes. So, the Count had little more than a moment to consider the nature of the commitment he was being asked to make. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Granted it was only for a month or two. He would not be responsible for the girl’s education, her moral instruction, or her religious upbringing. But her health and comfort? He would be responsible for those even were he to care for her for one night. What was she to eat? Where was she to sleep? </p>
<p class="calibre1">And, while it was his night off tonight, what was he to do with her the following evening, when he had to don the white jacket of the Boyarsky? </p>
<p class="calibre1">But let us imagine that before committing himself, the Count had had the time to see the problem in its full scope, to consider every challenge and obstacle, to acknowledge his own lack of experience, to concede that in all likelihood he was the least fitting, least well-equipped, and most poorly situated man in Moscow to care for a child. Had he the time and presence of mind to weigh all of this, would he have denied Nina her request? </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p232"/>He would not even have attempted to dissuade her. </p>
<p class="calibre1">How could he? </p>
<p class="calibre1">This was the very woman who, as a child herself, had crossed the Piazza without hesitation in order to become his friend; who had shown him the hidden corners of the hotel and bestowed upon him, quite literally, the key to its mysteries. When such a friend has sought one out to ask for aid—</p>
<p class="calibre1">particularly one for whom asking favors in a time of need does not come naturally—then there is only one acceptable response. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The Count slipped the photograph in his pocket. He composed himself. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Then he turned to find his new charge looking up at him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well, Sofia. Are you hungry? Would you like something to eat?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">She shook her head. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Then why don’t we head upstairs and get ourselves situated.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The Count helped Sofia down from the chair and led her across the lobby. But as he was about to mount the stairs, he noticed her staring when the elevator doors opened to let off two of the hotel’s guests. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Have you ever ridden on an elevator before?” he asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Gripping her doll by the neck, Sofia shook her head again. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“In that case . . .” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Holding the doors open, the Count gestured for Sofia to proceed. With an expression of cautious curiosity, she stepped onto the elevator, made room for the Count, and then watched as the doors slid shut. </p>
<p class="calibre1">With a theatrical flourish and the command of  <i class="calibre3">Presto! </i> the Count pressed the button for the fifth floor. The elevator lurched and began to move. Sofia steadied herself; then she leaned a little to her right so that she could watch the floors pass by through the caging. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“<i class="calibre3">Voilà</i>,” said the Count when they arrived a moment later at their destination. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Leading Sofia down the hall and into the belfry, the Count gestured again for her to proceed. But having looked up the narrow twisting stair, Sofia turned to the Count and raised both hands in the air in the international symbol of  <i class="calibre3">Pick me up</i>. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Hmm,” said the Count. Then despite his age, he picked her up. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She yawned. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Once in his room, the Count sat Sofia on his bed, put her knapsack on the Grand Duke’s desk, and then told her he would be right back. He</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p233"/>walked down the hall and retrieved a winter blanket from his trunk. His plan was to make her a small bed on the floor beside his own and lend her one of his pillows. He would just have to be careful not to step on her, should he wake in the night. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But the Count needn’t have worried about stepping on Sofia. For when he returned to his room with the blanket, she had already climbed under his covers and fallen asleep. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p234"/> <i class="calibre3"><b class="calibre4">Adjustments</b></i></p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre4">N</b>ever had the toll of a bell been so welcome. Not in Moscow. Not in Europe. Not in all the world. When the Frenchman Carpentier faced the American Dempsey, he could not have felt more relief upon hearing the clang that signaled the end of the third round than the Count felt upon hearing his own clock strike twelve. Nor could the citizens of Prague upon hearing the church bells that signaled the end of their siege at the hands of Frederick the Great. </p>
<p class="calibre1">What was it about this child that prompted a grown man to count so carefully the minutes until lunch? Did she prattle on nonsensically? Did she flit about giggling? Did she dissolve into tears or launch into tantrums at the slightest provocation? </p>
<p class="calibre1">On the contrary. She was quiet. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Unsettlingly so. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Upon waking she rose, dressed, and made her bed without a word. </p>
<p class="calibre1">When the Count served breakfast, she nibbled her biscuits like a Trappist. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Then, having quietly cleared her plate, she climbed up onto the Count’s desk chair, sat on her hands, and gazed at him in silence. And what a gaze it was. With irises as dark and foreboding as the deep, it was positively unnerving. Without shyness or impatience, it seemed simply to say:  <i class="calibre3">What</i> <i class="calibre3">now, Uncle Alexander? </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">What now, indeed. For having made their beds and nibbled their biscuits, the two of them had the whole day before them. 16 hours. 960</p>
<p class="calibre1">minutes. 57,600 seconds! </p>
<p class="calibre1">The notion was indisputably daunting. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But who was Alexander Rostov, if not a seasoned conversationalist? At weddings and name-day celebrations from Moscow to St. Petersburg, he had inevitably been seated beside the most recalcitrant of dinner guests. The prudish aunts and pompous uncles. The mirthless, mordant, and shy. Why? </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p235"/>Because Alexander Rostov could be counted upon to draw his dinner companions into a lively conversation, whatever their dispositions. </p>
<p class="calibre1">If he had happened to be seated beside Sofia at a dinner party—or, for that matter, in the compartment of a train traveling across the countryside—</p>
<p class="calibre1">what would he do? Naturally, he would ask about her life:  <i class="calibre3">Where are you</i> <i class="calibre3">from, my friend? Ivanovo, you say. I have never been, but always wanted to</i> <i class="calibre3">go. What is the best season to visit? And what should one see whilst one is</i> <i class="calibre3">there? </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">“So, tell me . . . ,” the Count began with a smile, as Sofia’s eyes opened wide. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But even as the words were leaving his lips, the Count was having second thoughts. For he was decidedly not seated beside Sofia at a dinner party, or in a railway car. She was a child who, with little explanation, had been uprooted from her home. To pursue a line of inquiry about the sights and seasons of Ivanovo or daily life with her parents was almost certain to raise a host of sad associations, spurring feelings of longing and loss. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“So, tell me . . . ,” he said again, feeling the onset of dizziness, as her eyes opened wider. But just in time, he had a flash of inspiration:</p>
<p class="calibre1">“What is your dolly’s name?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">A sure step, that one, thought the Count, with an inward pat on the back. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Dolly doesn’t have a name.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What’s that? No name? But surely, your doll  <i class="calibre3">must</i> have a name.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Sofia stared at the Count for a moment then tilted her head like a raven. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Why?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Why?” repeated the Count. “Why, so that she can be addressed. So that she can be invited for tea; called to from across the room; discussed in conversation when absent; and included in your prayers. That is, for all the very reasons that  <i class="calibre3">you</i> benefit from having a name.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">As Sofia considered this, the Count leaned forward, ready to elaborate on the matter to the smallest detail. But nodding once, the girl said, “I shall call her Dolly.” Then she looked to the Count with her big blue eyes as if to say:  <i class="calibre3">Now that that’s decided, what next? </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">The Count leaned back in his chair and began to sort through his vast catalog of casual questions, discarding one after another. But as luck would have it, he noticed that Sofia’s gaze had shifted almost furtively toward something behind him. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p236"/>Discreetly, the Count glanced back. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The ebony elephant, he realized with a smile. Raised her entire life in a rural province, the child had probably never even imagined that such an animal existed.  <i class="calibre3">What sort of fantastical beast is that? </i> she must be wondering.  <i class="calibre3">Is it mammal or reptile? Fact or fable? </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">“Have you ever seen one of those before?” the Count asked with a backward gesture and a smile. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“An elephant?” she asked. “Or a lamp?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The Count coughed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I meant an elephant.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Only in books,” she admitted a little sadly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Ah. Well. It is a magnificent animal. A wonder of creation.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Sofia’s interest piqued, the Count launched into a description of the species, animating each of its characteristics with an illustrative flourish of the arms. “A native of the Dark Continent, the mature example can weigh over ten thousand pounds. Its legs are as thick as tree trunks, and it bathes itself by drawing water into its proboscis and spraying it into the air—” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“So, you have seen one?” she interrupted brightly. “On the Dark Continent?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The Count fidgeted. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Not exactly on the Dark Continent . . .” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Then where?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“In various books . . .” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh,” said Sofia, bringing the topic to a close with the efficiency of the guillotine. </p>
<p class="calibre1">. . . </p>
<p class="calibre1">. . . </p>
<p class="calibre1">The Count considered for a moment what other sort of wonder might capture her imagination, but which he had actually seen in person. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Would you like to hear a story about a princess?” he suggested. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Sofia sat upright. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The age of the nobility has given way to the age of the common man,” </p>
<p class="calibre1">she said with the pride of one who has recited her times tables correctly. “It was historically inevitable.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes,” said the Count. “So I’ve been told.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">. . . </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p237"/>. . . </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Do you enjoy pictures?” he asked, picking up an illustrated guide to the Louvre that he had borrowed from the basement. “Here is a lifetime’s supply. While I wash up, why don’t you delve in?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Sofia moved a little in order to set Dolly at her side and then accepted the book in a ready and determined manner. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Retreating to the safety of the washroom, the Count took off his shirt, bathed his upper body, and lathered his cheeks, all the while muttering the principal riddle of the day:</p>
<p class="calibre1">“She is no more than thirty pounds; no more than three feet tall; her entire bag of belongings could fit in a single drawer; she rarely speaks unless spoken to; and her heart beats no louder than a bird’s. So how is it possible that she takes up so much space?!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Over the years, the Count had come to think of his rooms as rather ample. In the morning, they easily accommodated twenty squats and twenty stretches, a leisurely breakfast, and the reading of a novel in a tilted chair. In the evenings after work, they fostered flights of fancy, memories of travel, and meditations on history all crowned by a good night’s sleep. Yet somehow, this little visitor with her kit bag and her rag doll had altered every dimension of the room. She had simultaneously brought the ceiling downward, the floor upward, and the walls inward, such that anywhere he hoped to move she was already there. Having roused himself from a fitful night on the floor, when the Count was ready for his morning calisthenics, she was standing in the calisthenics spot. At breakfast, she ate more than her fair share of the strawberries; then when he was about to dip his second biscuit in his second cup of coffee, she was staring at it with such longing that he had no choice but to ask if she wanted it. And when, at last, he was ready to lean back in his chair with his book, she was already sitting in it, staring up at him expectantly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But having caught himself waving his shaving brush emphatically at his own reflection, the Count stopped cold. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">Good God</i>, he thought. Is it possible? </p>
<p class="calibre1">Already? </p>
<p class="calibre1">At the age of forty-eight? </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Alexander Rostov, could it be that you have become settled in your ways?” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p238"/>As a young man, the Count would  <i class="calibre3">never</i> have been inconvenienced by a fellow soul. He sought out congenial company the moment he awoke. </p>
<p class="calibre1">When he had read in his chair, no interruption could be counted as a disturbance. In fact, he preferred to read with a little racket in the background. Like the shouts of a vendor in the street; or the scales of a piano in a neighboring apartment; or best of all, footsteps on the stair—</p>
