  <body><p class="calibre1">The Count harrumphed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Just because I am a man of decorum does not mean that I am stodgy.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Anna smiled. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You do realize that you just harrumphed.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Maybe so. But I am still her father. What would you have me do? </p>
<p class="calibre1">Abdicate my responsibilities?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Abdicate!” replied Anna with a laugh. “Certainly not, Your Highness.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The two had reached the point in the hallway where the door to the service stair was hidden in plain sight. Stopping, the Count turned to Anna with the smile of the artificially polite. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p397"/><img src="index-397_1.jpg" class="calibre2"/></p>
<p class="calibre1">“It is time for the Boyarsky’s daily meeting. As a result, I am afraid that I must now bid you  <i class="calibre3">adieu</i>.” Then with a nod the Count disappeared behind the door. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Once he was descending the stairs, he felt a sense of relief. With its precise geometry and pervading silence, the belfry was much like a chapel or reading room—a place designed to provide one with solitude and respite. </p>
<p class="calibre1">That is, until the door opened and Anna stepped onto the landing. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In a state of disbelief, the Count remounted the stairs. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What are you doing?” he whispered. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I need to go to the lobby,” she replied. “I thought I’d keep you company on the way down.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You can’t keep me company. This is the service stair!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But I am a guest in the hotel.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That is my point exactly. The service stair is reserved for those who serve. Right down the hallway is a glamorous staircase reserved for the glamorous.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Anna smiled and took a step toward the Count. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What’s gotten your goat?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Nothing has gotten my goat. My goat is not gotten.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I suppose it’s understandable,” she continued philosophically. “A father is bound to be a little unnerved by the discovery that his daughter has become a beautiful young woman.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I was not unnerved,” the Count said, taking a step back. “My only point was that the back of the dress did not have to be cut quite as low.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You must admit that her back is lovely.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That may be so. But the world needn’t be presented with every single one of her vertebrae.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Anna took another step forward. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You have often admired my vertebrae. . . .” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That’s something else entirely.” The Count tried to take another step back, but came up against the wall. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’ll give you the Comet of 1812,” Anna said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Shall we begin?” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p398"/>This shockingly straightforward question came from none other than the man who ate, drank, and slept on the bias. </p>
<p class="calibre1">With a grunt, Emile slid his menu across the desk. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The Count and Andrey shifted in their chairs. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Having begun attending the Boyarsky’s daily meeting in the summer of 1953, in April of 1954 the Bishop had switched the venue from Emile’s office to his own, on the grounds that the activity in the kitchen was proving a distraction. To accommodate the members of the Triumvirate, the manager had three French chairs lined up in front of his desk. The chairs had such delicate proportions one could only assume that they had originally been designed for handmaidens in the court of Louis XIV. Which is to say, it was virtually impossible for grown men to sit in them at ease, especially when tucked in a tight little row. The general effect was to make the Boyarsky’s maître d’, chef, and headwaiter feel like schoolboys called before their principal. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Accepting the menu, the Bishop squared it with the edge of his desk. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Then with the tip of his pencil he reviewed each item in the manner of a banker double-checking the sums of his apprentice. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Naturally enough, in the interim the three schoolboys found themselves looking about. If only the walls had been decorated with maps of the world or a periodic table, they could have made fruitful use of the time—by imagining they were Columbus crossing the Atlantic or an alchemist in ancient Alexandria. With only the portraits of Stalin, Lenin, and Marx to consider, the three men had no choice but to fidget. </p>
<p class="calibre1">When the Bishop had edited Emile’s menu and returned it to the chef, with a sniff he turned to Andrey, who dutifully delivered the Book. As usual, the Bishop opened to the beginning and the Triumvirate watched in mute exasperation as he turned through the pages until he finally reached the last night of May. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Here we are,” he said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Again, the tip of the banker’s pencil moved from entry to entry, column by column, row by row. The Bishop provided Andrey with seating instructions for the night and set down his pencil. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Sensing the meeting was about to end, the members of the Triumvirate moved to the edge of their chairs. But rather than close the Book, the</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p399"/>Bishop suddenly flipped ahead to survey the upcoming weeks. After turning a few pages, he paused. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“How are preparations coming for the combined dinner of the Presidium and the Council of Ministers . . . ?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Andrey cleared his throat. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“All is in order. At official request, the dinner is to be held not in the Red Room but in suite 417, which Arkady has arranged to be free; Emile has just finalized the menu; and Alexander, who will be overseeing the dinner, has been working closely with comrade Propp, our liaison from the Kremlin, to ensure the evening runs smoothly.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The Bishop looked up from the Book. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Given the importance of the event, shouldn’t you be overseeing it personally, Maître d’ Duras?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It was my intention to stay in the Boyarsky, as usual. But I could certainly attend to the dinner, if you thought that preferable.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Excellent,” said the Bishop. “Then Headwaiter Rostov can stay at the restaurant to ensure that all goes accordingly there.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">As the Bishop closed the Book, the Count went cold. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The dinner for the Presidium and Council of Ministers was tailor made to his intentions. He could not conceive of a better occasion. But even if there were one, with just sixteen days until the Conservatory’s tour, the Count was simply out of time. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The Bishop slid the Book back across his desk and the meeting was concluded. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As usual, the members of the Triumvirate walked from the principal’s office to the stairwell in silence. But at the landing, when Emile began climbing the stairs to the second floor, the Count took Andrey by the sleeve. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Andrey, my friend,” he said under his breath. “Can you spare a moment . . . ?” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p400"/> <i class="calibre3"><b class="calibre4">An Announcement</b></i></p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre4">A</b>t 6:45 on the eleventh of June, Count Alexander Rostov stood in suite 417 dressed in the white jacket of the Boyarsky, ensuring that the place settings were properly arranged and his men properly attired before opening the doors for the 1954 combined dinner of the Presidium and the Council of Ministers. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Eleven days earlier, as we know, the Count had been excused from this duty rather unceremoniously. But early on the afternoon of the tenth of June, Maître d’ Duras arrived at the Boyarsky’s daily meeting with distressing news. For some time, he said, he had been experiencing a tremor of the hands consistent with the onset of palsy. After a troubled night’s sleep, he had awakened to discover that the condition had grown considerably worse. By way of illustration, he held his right hand over the table where it trembled like a leaf. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Emile looked on with an expression of shock.  <i class="calibre3">What sort of Divinity</i>, he seemed to be thinking,  <i class="calibre3">would devise a world in which an aging man’s</i> <i class="calibre3">malady afflicts the very attribute that has set him apart from his fellow men</i> <i class="calibre3">and elevated him in the eyes of all? </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">What sort of Divinity, Emile? The very same who rendered Beethoven deaf and Monet blind. For what the Lord giveth, is precisely what he cometh later to taketh away. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But if Emile’s face expressed an almost sacrilegious indignation at his friend’s condition, the Bishop’s expressed the grimace of the inconvenienced. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Noting the manager’s annoyance, Andrey sought to set his mind at ease. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You needn’t worry, Manager Leplevsky. I have already contacted comrade Propp at the Kremlin and assured him that while I cannot oversee tomorrow night’s event, Headwaiter Rostov will be assuming my responsibilities. Needless to say,” the maître d’ added, “comrade Propp was greatly relieved by the news.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p401"/><img src="index-401_1.jpg" class="calibre2"/></p>
<p class="calibre1">“Of course,” said the Bishop. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In reporting that comrade Propp was greatly relieved to have Headwaiter Rostov at the helm of this dinner of state, Andrey was not exaggerating. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Born ten years after the Revolution, comrade Propp didn’t know that Headwaiter Rostov was under house arrest at the Metropol; he didn’t even know that Headwaiter Rostov was a Former Person. What he did know—</p>
<p class="calibre1">and from personal experience—was that Headwaiter Rostov could be counted upon to attend to every detail on the table and respond immediately to the slightest hint of a customer’s dissatisfaction. And though comrade Propp was still relatively inexperienced in the ways of the Kremlin, he was experienced enough to know that any shortcomings in the evening would be laid at his door as surely as if he had set the table, cooked the meal, and poured the wine himself. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Comrade Propp personally communicated his relief to the Count during a brief meeting on the morning of the event. At a table for two in the Boyarsky, the young liaison reviewed with the Count, quite unnecessarily, all the details of the evening: the timing (the doors were to be opened promptly at 9:00); the layout of the tables (a long U with twenty seats on either side and six at the head); the menu (Chef Zhukovsky’s interpretation of a traditional Russian feast); the wine (a Ukrainian white); and the necessity of dousing the candles at exactly 10:59. Then, perhaps to emphasize the evening’s importance, comrade Propp gave the Count a glimpse of the guest list. </p>
<p class="calibre1">While it’s true that the Count generally hadn’t concerned himself with the inner workings of the Kremlin, that is not to suggest that he was unfamiliar with the names on that piece of paper—for he had served them all. Certainly, he had served them at formal functions in the Red and Yellow Rooms, but he had also served them at the more intimate and less guarded tables of the Boyarsky when they had dined with wives or mistresses, friends or enemies, patrons or protégés. He knew the boorish from the abrupt and the bitter from the boastful. He had seen all of them sober and most of them drunk. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p402"/><img src="index-402_1.jpg" class="calibre2"/></p>
<p class="calibre1">“All will be seen to,” said the Count as the young apparatchik stood to go. “But, comrade Propp . . .” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Comrade Propp paused. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes, Headwaiter Rostov? Have I forgotten something?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You haven’t given me the seating arrangement.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Ah. Not to worry. Tonight there is to be no seating arrangement.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Then rest assured,” the Count replied with a smile, “the evening is bound to be a success.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Why was the Count so pleased to hear that this dinner of state would have no seating arrangement? </p>
<p class="calibre1">For a thousand years, civilizations the world over have recognized the head of the table as a privileged spot. Upon seeing a formally set table, one knows instinctively that the seat at the head is more desirable than those along the sides—because it inevitably confers upon its occupant an appearance of power, importance, and legitimacy. By extension, one also knows that the farther one sits from the head, the less powerful, important, and legitimate one is likely to be perceived. So, to invite forty-six leaders of a political party to dine around the periphery of an extended U without a seating arrangement was to risk a certain amount of disorder. . . . </p>
<p class="calibre1">Thomas Hobbes, no doubt, would have likened the situation to “Man in a State of Nature” and would have counseled one to expect a scuffle. Born with similar faculties and driven by similar desires, the forty-six men in attendance had equal right to any seat at the table. As such, what was most likely to ensue was a scrum for the head, animated by accusations, recriminations, fisticuffs, and possibly gunfire. </p>
<p class="calibre1">John Locke, on the other hand, would argue that once the dining room’s doors were opened, after a brief moment of confusion the better natures of the forty-six men would prevail, and their predisposition to reason would lead them to a fair and orderly process of seat taking. Thus, in all likelihood, the attendees would draw lots to decide their placement, or simply reconfigure the tables into a circle—just as King Arthur had, to ensure the equity of his knights. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p403"/><img src="index-403_1.jpg" class="calibre2"/></p>
<p class="calibre1">Chiming in from the mid-eighteenth century, Jean Jacques Rousseau would inform Messrs. Locke and Hobbes that the forty-six guests—freed at long last from the tyranny of social conventions—would shove the tables aside, gather the fruits of the earth in hand, and share them freely in a state of natural bliss! </p>
<p class="calibre1">But the Communist Party was not a “State of Nature.” Quite to the contrary, it was one of the most intricate and purposeful constructions ever manufactured by man. In essence: the hierarchy of all hierarchies. </p>
<p class="calibre1">So, when the guests arrived, the Count was fairly certain that there would be no raising of fists, drawing of lots, or free-spirited sharing of fruits. Rather, with only the slightest jostling and jockeying, each of the forty-six attendees would find their proper place at the table; and this</p>
<p class="calibre1">“spontaneous” arrangement would tell the studious observer all he needed to know about the governance of Russia for the next twenty years. </p>
<p class="calibre1">At the Count’s signal, the doors to suite 417 were opened at precisely 9:00</p>
<p class="calibre1">P.M. By 9:15, forty-six men of various rank and seniority were taking the seats appropriate to their station. Without a word of orchestration, the head of the table was left to Bulganin, Khrushchev, Malenkov, Mikoyan, Molotov, and Voroshilov—the six most eminent members of the Party—</p>
<p class="calibre1">with the two center seats reserved for Premier Malenkov and General Secretary Khrushchev. <a href="#p466">*</a></p>
<p class="calibre1">In fact, as if to make the point, when Khrushchev entered the room he didn’t even walk in the direction of the table’s head. Rather, he exchanged a few remarks with Vyacheslav Malyshev, the rather mundane Minister of Medium Machine Building who was sitting near the table’s end. Only when everyone else was comfortable did the former mayor of Moscow pat Malyshev on the shoulder and casually work his way to the seat beside Malenkov—the last empty chair in the room. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Over the next two hours, the men in attendance ate heartily, drank freely, and gave toasts that ranged in tone from the high-minded to the humorous, but always in the most patriotic of spirits. And in between toasts, as the Count presented courses, refilled glasses, replaced utensils, whisked away plates, and swept crumbs from the linens, the attendees made asides to the</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p404"/><img src="index-404_1.jpg" class="calibre2"/></p>
<p class="calibre1">men on their left, conferred with the men on their right, or muttered to themselves under the hum of the festivities. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Upon reading this, you may be tempted to ask a little sardonically whether Count Rostov—this self-proclaimed man of propriety—allowed himself to overhear any of the private exchanges around the table? But your question and your cynicism would be entirely misplaced. For as with the best manservants, it is the  <i class="calibre3">business</i> of capable waiters to overhear. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Consider the example of Grand Duke Demidov’s butler. In his day, Kemp could stand for hours at the edge of the library as silent and stiff as a statue. But should one of the Grand Duke’s guests even mention that he was thirsty, Kemp was there with an offer of a drink. Should someone complain quietly of a chill, Kemp was at the fireside stirring the coals. And when the Grand Duke observed to a friend that while the Countess Shermatova was</p>
<p class="calibre1">“a delight,” her son was “unreliable,” Kemp would know without being told that should either of the Shermatovas appear at the door unannounced, the Grand Duke was available to the one and indisposed to the other. </p>
<p class="calibre1">So, did the Count overhear any of the private exchanges of the attendees? Did he hear any of the sly observations, pointed asides, or dismissive remarks uttered  <i class="calibre3">sotto voce</i>? </p>
<p class="calibre1">He heard every single word. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Every man has his own personality at table, and one needn’t have waited upon members of the Communist Party for twenty-eight years to know that while comrade Malenkov only toasted upon occasion and then with a glass of white wine, comrade Khrushchev would give four toasts in an evening and always with vodka. Thus, it did not escape the Count’s notice that during the course of the meal, the former mayor of Moscow never once rose to his feet. But at ten minutes to eleven, when the meal was nearly over, the General Secretary rapped on his glass with the blade of his knife. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Gentlemen,” he began, “the Metropol is no stranger to historic events. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In fact, in 1918 comrade Sverdlov locked the members of the constitutional drafting committee in the suite two floors below us—informing them that they would not be let out until their work was done.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Laughter and applause. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p405"/>“To Sverdlov!” someone called and, as Khrushchev emptied his glass with a self-assured grin, all around the table followed suit. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Tonight,” continued Khrushchev, “we have the honor of witnessing another historic event at the Metropol. If you will join me at the windows, comrades, I believe that Minister Malyshev has an announcement. . . .” </p>
<p class="calibre1">With expressions ranging from curious to bemused, the forty-four other attendees pushed back their chairs and approached the great windows overlooking Theatre Square, where Malyshev was already standing. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Thank you, General Secretary,” Malyshev said with a bow toward Khrushchev, followed by a weighty pause: “Comrades, as most of you know, three and a half years ago we began construction of our new power plant in the city of Obninsk. I am proud to announce that on Monday afternoon the Obninsk facility became fully operational—six months ahead of schedule.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Appropriate commendations and the nodding of heads. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Furthermore,” Malyshev continued, “at exactly eleven o’clock tonight</p>
<p class="calibre1">—in less than two minutes—the plant will begin providing power to half the city of Moscow. . . .” </p>
<p class="calibre1">With that, Malyshev turned and faced the windows (as the Count and Martyn quietly snuffed the candles on the table). Outside, the lights of Moscow glimmered in the same old fashion, such that as the seconds ticked by, the men in the room began shifting on their feet and exchanging remarks. But suddenly, in the far northwestern corner of the city, the lights in a neighborhood ten blocks square went out all at once. A moment later, the lights went out in the adjacent quarter. Then the darkness began moving across the city like a shadow across a plain, growing closer and closer, until at roughly 11:02, the eternally lit windows of the Kremlin went black, followed a few seconds later by those of the Metropol Hotel. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In the darkness, the mutterings of a moment before rose in volume and shifted in tone, expressing some combination of surprise and consternation. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But the attentive observer could see from Malyshev’s silhouette that when the darkness fell, he neither spoke nor moved. He continued to stare out the window. Suddenly, in the far northwest corner of the capital, the lights of those initially darkened blocks flickered back on. Now it was luminescence that was moving across the city, growing closer and closer, until the windows of the Kremlin flashed on followed by the chandelier overhead—</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p406"/><img src="index-406_1.jpg" class="calibre2"/></p>
<p class="calibre1">and the combined dinner of the Presidium and the Council of Ministers erupted into justified applause. For, in fact, the lights of the city seemed to burn brighter with the electricity from the first nuclear power plant in the world. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Without a doubt, the finale to this dinner of state was as fine a piece of political theater as Moscow had ever seen. But when the lights went out, were any of the city’s citizens inconvenienced? </p>
<p class="calibre1">Luckily, in 1954 Moscow was not the world capital of electrical appliances. But in the brief course of the outage, at least three hundred thousand clocks stopped, forty thousand radios went silent, and five thousand televisions went black. Dogs howled and cats meowed. Standing lamps were toppled, children cried, parents banged their shins into coffee tables, and more than a few drivers—looking up through their windshields at the suddenly darkened buildings—ran into the fenders of the automobiles in front of them. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In that little gray building on the corner of Dzerzhinsky Street, the little gray fellow who was charged with taking down the eavesdroppings of waitresses kept right on typing. For like any good bureaucrat, he knew how to type with his eyes closed. Although, when a few moments after the lights went out someone stumbled in the hallway and our startled typist looked up, his fingers inadvertently shifted one column of keys to the right, such that the second half of his report was either unintelligible, or in code, depending upon your point of view. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Meanwhile, at the Maly Theatre, where Anna Urbanova—in a wig tinged with gray—was appearing as Irina Arkadina in Chekhov’s  <i class="calibre3">The</i> <i class="calibre3">Seagull</i>, the audience let out muted exclamations of concern. Though Anna and her fellow actors were well practiced at leaving the stage in the dark, they made no move to do so. For having been trained in the methods of Stanislavsky, they immediately began acting exactly as their characters would have acted had they suddenly found themselves in a blackout: ARKADINA: [ <i class="calibre3">Alarmed</i>] The lights have gone out! </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p407"/>TRIGORIN: Stay where you are, my dear. I’ll look for a candle. </p>
<p class="calibre1">[ <i class="calibre3">The sound of cautious movement as TRIGORIN exits right,</i> <i class="calibre3">followed by a moment of silence</i>]</p>
<p class="calibre1">ARKADINA: Oh, Konstantin. I’m frightened. </p>
<p class="calibre1">KONSTANTIN: It is only darkness, Mother—that from which</p>
<p class="calibre1">we have come and to which we shall return. </p>
<p class="calibre1">ARKADINA: [ <i class="calibre3">As if she hasn’t listened to her son</i>] Do you think the lights have gone out all over Russia? </p>
<p class="calibre1">KONSTANTIN: No, Mother. They have gone out all over the</p>
<p class="calibre1">world. . . . </p>
<p class="calibre1">And at the Metropol? Two waiters in the Piazza carrying trays to their tables collided; four customers in the Shalyapin spilled their drinks and one was pinched; trapped in the elevator between the second and third floors, the American, Pudgy Webster, shared chocolate bars and cigarettes with his fellow passengers; while alone in his office, the hotel’s manager vowed “to get to the bottom of this.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">But in the dining room of the Boyarsky, where for almost fifty years the ambience had been defined by candlelight, the customers were served without interruption. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p408"/> <i class="calibre3"><b class="calibre4">Anecdotes</b></i></p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre4">O</b>n the night of the sixteenth of June, beside Sofia’s empty suitcase and knapsack, the Count laid out all of the various items that he had collected on her behalf. The night before, when she’d returned from rehearsal, he had sat her down and explained exactly what it was that she must do. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Why have you waited until now to speak of this?” she asked, on the verge of tears. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I was afraid if I told you earlier, you would object.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But I do object.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I know,” he said, taking her hands. “But oftentimes, Sofia, our best course of action appears objectionable at the first step. In fact, it almost always does.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">What followed was a debate between father and daughter on the whys and wherefores, a contrasting of perspectives, a comparison of time horizons, and heartfelt expressions of conflicting hopes. But in the end, the Count asked Sofia that she trust him; and this proved to be a request that she did not know how to refuse. So, after a moment of shared silence, with the courage that she had shown since the first day they’d met, Sofia listened attentively as the Count went over every detail step by step. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Tonight, as he finished laying out the items, the Count reviewed the same details for himself, to ensure that nothing had been forgotten or overlooked; and he was feeling, at last, that everything was in order, when the door flung open. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“They have changed the venue!” Sofia exclaimed, out of breath. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Father and daughter traded anxious looks. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“To what?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">About to answer, Sofia stopped and closed her eyes. Then opened them with a suggestion of distress. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I can’t remember.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p409"/>“It’s all right,” assured the Count, knowing full well that distress was no friend to recollection. “What did the director say exactly? Do you remember anything about the new location? Any aspect of its neighborhood or name?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Sofia closed her eyes again. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It was a hall, I think . . . , a  <i class="calibre3">salle</i>.  <i class="calibre3">” </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">“The Salle Pleyel?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That’s it!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The Count breathed a sigh of relief. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We needn’t worry. I know the spot well. A historic venue with fine acoustics—which also happens to be in the 8th. . .” </p>
<p class="calibre1">So, as Sofia packed her bags, the Count went down to the basement. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Having found the second Paris  <i class="calibre3">Baedeker</i>, he tore out the map, climbed the stairs, sat at the Grand Duke’s desk, and drew a new red line. Then when all the straps were tightened and the latches snapped, with a touch of ceremony the Count ushered Sofia through the closet door into the study, much as he had sixteen years before. And just as on that occasion, Sofia said: “Ooo.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">For since she had set out earlier that afternoon to attend her last rehearsal, their secret study had been transformed. On the bookcase a candelabra burned brightly. The two high-back chairs had been set at either end of the Countess’s oriental coffee table, which in turn had been draped with linen, decorated with a small arrangement of flowers, and set with the hotel’s finest silver. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Your table awaits,” said the Count with a smile, pulling out Sofia’s chair. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Okroshka?” she asked as she put her napkin in her lap. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Absolutely,” said the Count, taking his seat. “Before one travels abroad, it is best to have a simple, heartwarming soup from home, so that one can recall it fondly should one ever happen to feel a little low.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I shall be sure to do so,” said Sofia with a smile, “the minute I become homesick.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">As they were finishing their soup, Sofia noticed that tucked beside the arrangement of flowers was a little silver lady in an eighteenth-century dress. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What is that?” she asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p410"/>“Why don’t you see for yourself.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Sofia picked up the little lady and, hearing the hint of a jangle, waggled it back and forth. At the sound of the resulting chime, the door to the study swung open and in came Andrey pushing a Regency cart topped with a silver dome. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">“Bonsoir, Monsieur! Bonsoir, Mademoiselle!” </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">Sofia laughed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I trust you enjoyed the soup,” he said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It was delicious.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“<i class="calibre3">Très bien. </i>” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Andrey whisked the bowls from the table and stowed them on the bottom shelf of his cart as the Count and Sofia looked to the silver dome with anticipation. But when Andrey stood back up, instead of revealing what Chef Zhukovsky had in store for them, he produced a pad. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Before I serve the next course,” he explained, “I will need you to confirm your satisfaction with the soup. Please sign here and here and here.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The look of shock on the Count’s face prompted a burst of laughter from both Andrey and Sofia. Then with a flourish, the maître d’ raised the dome and presented Emile’s newest specialty: Goose à la Sofia. “In which,” he explained, “the goose is hoisted in a dumbwaiter, chased down a hall, and thrown from a window before being roasted.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Andrey carved the bird, served the vegetables, and poured the Château Margaux all in a single motion of the hands. Then he wished the diners</p>
<p class="calibre1">“<i class="calibre3">Bon appétit</i>” as he backed out the door. </p>
<p class="calibre1">While the two enjoyed Emile’s latest creation, the Count recalled for Sofia in some detail the commotion he had found on the fourth floor that morning in 1946—including the army-issue briefs that Richard Vanderwhile had saluted. And this somehow led to a retelling of the time that Anna Urbanova threw all her clothes out the window, only to gather them back up in the middle of the night. Which is to say, they shared those humorous little stories of which family lore is made. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Perhaps some will find this surprising, having supposed that the Count would reserve this particular dinner for an offering of Polonial advice or expressions of heartache. But the Count had quite intentionally chosen to</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p411"/>see to all of that the night before, after their discussion of what was to be done. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Showing a sense of personal restraint that was almost out of character, the Count had restricted himself to two succinct pieces of parental advice. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The first was that if one did not master one’s circumstances, one was bound to be mastered by them; and the second was Montaigne’s maxim that the surest sign of wisdom is constant cheerfulness. But when it came to expressing admissions of heartache, the Count had not held back. He told her exactly how sad he would be in her absence, and yet, how joyful he would feel at the slightest thought of her grand adventure. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Why was the Count so careful to ensure that all of this was covered on the night before Sofia’s journey? Because well he knew that when one is traveling abroad for the first time, one does not wish to look back on laborsome instructions, weighty advice, or tearful sentiments. Like the memory of the simple soup, when one is homesick what one will find most comforting to recall are those lighthearted little stories that have been told a thousand times before. </p>
<p class="calibre1">That said, when their plates were finally empty, the Count attempted to broach a new subject that had clearly weighed on his mind. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I was thinking . . . ,” he began rather haltingly. “Or rather, it occurred to me, that you might like . . . Or at some point, perhaps . . .” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Amused to see her father so uncharacteristically flummoxed, Sofia laughed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What is it, Papa? What might I like?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Reaching into his jacket, the Count sheepishly removed the photograph that Mishka had tucked into the pages of his project. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I know how you treasure the photograph of your parents, so I thought . . . you might like a picture of me, as well.” Blushing for the first time in over forty years, he handed her the picture, adding: “It’s the only one I have.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Genuinely moved, Sofia accepted the photograph with every intention of expressing her deepest gratitude; but getting a look at the picture, she clapped a hand over her mouth and began to laugh. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Your moustaches!” she blurted. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I know, I know,” he said. “Although, believe it or not, at one time, they were the envy of the Jockey Club. . . .” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p412"/>Sofia laughed aloud again. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“All right,” said the Count, holding out his hand. “If you don’t want it, I understand.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">But she gripped the picture to her chest. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I wouldn’t part with it for the world.” Smiling, she took another peek at his moustaches then looked up at her father in wonder. “Whatever happened to them?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What happened to them, indeed . . .” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Taking a considerable drink of his wine, the Count told Sofia of the afternoon in 1922 when one of his moustaches had been clipped so unceremoniously by a heavyset fellow in the hotel’s barbershop. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What a brute.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes,” agreed the Count, “and a glimpse of things to come. But, in a way, I have that fellow to thank for my life with you.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“How do you mean?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The Count explained how a few days after the incident in the barbershop, her mother had popped up at his table in the Piazza to ask, in essence, the very same question that Sofia had just asked:  <i class="calibre3">Where did they</i> <i class="calibre3">go? </i> And with that simple inquiry, their friendship had commenced. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Now it was Sofia who took a drink from her wine. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Do you ever regret coming back to Russia?” she asked after a moment. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I mean after the Revolution.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The Count studied his daughter. If when Sofia had stepped out of Anna’s room in her blue dress, the Count had felt she was crossing the threshold into adulthood, then here was a perfect confirmation. For in both tone and intent, when Sofia posed this question she did not do so as a child asks a parent, but as one adult asks another about the choices he has made. So the Count gave the question its due consideration. Then he told her the truth:</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Looking back, it seems to me that there are people who play an essential role at every turn. And I don’t just mean the Napoleons who influence the course of history; I mean men and women who routinely appear at critical junctures in the progress of art, or commerce, or the evolution of ideas—as if Life itself has summoned them once again to help fulfill its purpose. Well, since the day I was born, Sofia, there was only one time when Life needed me to be in a particular place at a particular time, and that was when your mother brought you to the lobby of the Metropol. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p413"/>And I would not accept the Tsarship of all the Russias in exchange for being in this hotel at that hour.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Sofia rose from the table to give her father a kiss on the cheek. Then returning to her chair, she leaned back, squinted, and said: “Famous threesomes.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Ha-ha!” exclaimed the Count. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Thus, as the candles were consumed by their flames and the bottle of Margaux was drunk to its lees, reference was made to the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost; Purgatory, Heaven, and Hell; the three rings of Moscow; the three Magi; the three Fates; the Three Musketeers; the gray ladies from  <i class="calibre3">Macbeth</i>; the riddle of the Sphinx; the heads of Cerberus; the Pythagorean theorem; forks, spoons, and knives; reading, writing, and arithmetic; faith, hope, and love (with the greatest of these being love). </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Past, present, future.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Beginning, middle, end.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Morning, noon, and night.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The sun, the moon, the stars.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">And with this particular category, perhaps the game could have gone on all night long, but for the fact that the Count tipped over his own king with a bow of the head when Sofia said:</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Andrey, Emile, and Alexander.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">At ten o’clock, when the Count and Sofia snuffed the candles and returned to their bedroom, there was a delicate knock at the door. The two looked at each other with the wistful smiles of those who know the hour has come. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Enter,” said the Count. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It was Marina, in her hat and coat. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’m sorry if I’m late.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No, no. You’re right on time.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">As Sofia took a jacket from the closet, the Count picked up her suitcase and knapsack from the bed. Then the three of them headed down the belfry to the fifth floor, where they exited, crossed the hallway, and continued their descent on the main staircase. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Earlier that day, Sofia had already said her good-byes to Arkady and Vasily; nonetheless, they came out from behind their desks to see her off, and they were joined a moment later by Andrey in his tuxedo and Emile in</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p414"/><img src="index-414_1.jpg" class="calibre2"/></p>
<p class="calibre1">his apron. Even Audrius appeared from behind the bar of the Shalyapin, leaving his customers unattended for a change. This little assembly gathered around Sofia in a circle of well-wishing, while feeling that touch of envy which is perfectly acceptable among family and friends, from one generation to the next. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You’ll be the belle of Paris,” one of them said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We can’t wait to hear all about it.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Someone get her suitcase for her.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes, her train is leaving within the hour!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">When Marina went outside to call for a taxi, as if by prior agreement Arkady, Vasily, Audrius, Andrey, and Emile all fell a few paces back—so that the Count and Sofia could have a few final words alone. Then father and daughter embraced, and Sofia, despite being uncertain of acclaim, passed through the endlessly spinning doors of the Metropol Hotel. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Returning to the sixth floor, the Count spent a moment looking around his bedroom from corner to corner, finding that it already seemed unnaturally quiet. </p>
<p class="calibre1">So this is an empty nest, he thought. What a sad state of affairs <i class="calibre3">. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">Pouring himself a glass of brandy and taking a good swallow, he sat down at the Grand Duke’s desk and wrote five letters on the hotel’s stationery. When he was done, the Count put the letters in the drawer, he brushed his teeth, he donned his pajamas, and then, despite the fact that Sofia was gone, he slept on the mattress under the bedsprings. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p415"/> <i class="calibre3"><b class="calibre4">An Association</b></i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">With the coming of the Second World War, many eyes in imprisoned Europe</i> <i class="calibre3">turned hopefully, or desperately, toward the freedom of the Americas. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">Lisbon became the great embarkation point. But not everybody could get to</i> <i class="calibre3">Lisbon directly, and so, a tortuous, roundabout refugee trail sprang up. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">Paris to Marseilles, across the Mediterranean to Oran, then by train, or</i> <i class="calibre3">auto, or foot, across the rim of Africa to Casablanca in French Morocco. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">Here, the fortunate ones, through money, or influence, or luck, might obtain</i> <i class="calibre3">exit visas and scurry to Lisbon, and from Lisbon to the New World. But the</i> <i class="calibre3">others wait in Casablanca—and wait—and wait—and wait. . . . </i></p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre4">I</b>’ve got to hand it to you, Alexander,” whispered Osip. “This was an excellent choice. I’d quite forgotten how exciting it is.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Shhh,” said the Count. “It’s beginning. . . .” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Having initiated their studies in 1930 with monthly meetings, over the years the Count and Osip had met with less frequency. In the way of these things, the two men began meeting quarterly, then semiannually, then suddenly they weren’t meeting at all. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">Why? </i> you might ask. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But does there need to be a reason? Do you still dine with all of the friends with whom you dined twenty years ago? Suffice it to say that the two shared a fondness for each other and despite their best intentions, life intervened. So, when Osip happened to visit the Boyarsky with a colleague one night in early June, as he was leaving the restaurant he approached the Count in order to remark that it had been too long. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes, it has,” agreed the Count. “We should get together for a film.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The sooner the better,” said Osip with a smile. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p416"/><img src="index-416_1.jpg" class="calibre2"/></p>
<p class="calibre1">And the two men might have left it at that, but as Osip turned to join his colleague at the door, the Count was struck by a notion. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What is an intention when compared to a plan?” he said, catching Osip by the sleeve. “If  <i class="calibre3">the sooner the better</i>, then why not next week?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Turning back, Osip considered the Count for a moment. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You know, you’re absolutely right, Alexander. How about the nineteenth?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The nineteenth would be perfect.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What shall we watch?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Without hesitation the Count said, “<i class="calibre3">Casablanca</i>.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“<i class="calibre3">Casablanca</i> . . . ,” Osip groaned. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Isn’t Humphrey Bogart your favorite?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Of course he is. But  <i class="calibre3">Casablanca</i> isn’t a Humphrey Bogart movie. It’s just a love story in which he happens to appear.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“On the contrary, I suggest to you that  <i class="calibre3">Casablanca</i> is  <i class="calibre3">the</i> Humphrey Bogart movie.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You just think that because he wears a white dinner jacket for half the film.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That’s preposterous,” the Count replied a little stiffly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Maybe it’s a little preposterous,” conceded Osip, “but I don’t  <i class="calibre3">want</i> to watch  <i class="calibre3">Casablanca</i>.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Not one to be outmaneuvered by another man’s childishness, the Count pouted. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“All right,” Osip sighed. “But if you get to pick the film, I get to pick the food.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">As it turned out, once the film was flickering Osip was rapt. After all, there was the murder of two German couriers in the desert, then the rounding up of suspects in the marketplace, the shooting of a fugitive, the pickpocketing of a Brit, the arrival by plane of the Gestapo, music and gambling at Rick’s Café Américain, as well as the stashing of two letters of transit in a piano—</p>
<p class="calibre1">and that was in the first ten minutes! </p>
<p class="calibre1">In minute twenty, when Captain Renault instructed his officer to take Ugarte quietly and the officer saluted, Osip saluted too. When Ugarte</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p417"/>cashed in his winnings, Osip cashed in his. And when Ugarte dashed between the guards, slammed the door, drew his pistol, and fired four shots, Osip dashed, slammed, drew, and fired. </p>
<p class="calibre1">[ <i class="calibre3">With nowhere to hide, Ugarte runs madly down the hallway. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">Seeing Rick appear from the opposite direction, he grabs</i> <i class="calibre3">him. </i>]</p>
<p class="calibre1">UGARTE: Rick! Rick, help me! </p>
<p class="calibre1">RICK: Don’t be a fool. You can’t get away. </p>
<p class="calibre1">UGARTE: Rick, hide me. Do something! You must help me, </p>
<p class="calibre1">Rick. Do something! Rick! Rick! </p>
<p class="calibre1">[ <i class="calibre3">Rick stands impassively as guards and gendarmes drag Ugarte</i> <i class="calibre3">off. </i>]</p>
<p class="calibre1">CUSTOMER: When they come to get me, Rick, I hope you’ll be more of a help. </p>
<p class="calibre1">RICK: I stick my neck out for nobody. </p>
<p class="calibre1">[ <i class="calibre3">Moving casually among the tables and disconcerted customers,</i> <i class="calibre3">some of whom are on the point of leaving, Rick speaks to the</i> <i class="calibre3">room in a calm voice. </i>]</p>
<p class="calibre1">RICK: I’m sorry there was a disturbance, folks, but it’s all over now. Everything’s all right. Just sit down and have a good time. Enjoy yourself. . . . All right, Sam. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As Sam and his orchestra began to play, restoring something of a carefree mood to the saloon, Osip leaned toward the Count. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You may have been right, Alexander. This may be Bogart at his best. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Did you see the indifference he expressed as Ugarte was practically pulled from his lapels? And when that superior American makes his smug remark, Bogart doesn’t even deign to look at him when he replies. Then after instructing the piano player to play, he goes about his business as if nothing has happened.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Listening to Osip with a frown, the Count suddenly stood and switched off the projector. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Are we going to watch the movie, or talk about it?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Taken aback, Osip assured his friend: “We’re going to watch.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p418"/>“Until the end?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Until the credits roll.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Thus, the Count switched the projector back on while Osip paid his utmost attention to the screen. </p>
<p class="calibre1">If the truth be told, having made such a fuss about attentiveness, the Count did not pay  <i class="calibre3">his</i> utmost attention to the progress of the movie. Yes, he was watching closely enough when at minute thirty-eight Sam finds Rick drinking whiskey alone in the saloon. But when the smoke from Rick’s cigarette dissolves into a montage of his days in Paris with Ilsa, the Count’s thoughts dissolved into a Parisian montage of his own. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Unlike Rick’s, however, the Count’s montage did not draw on his memories; it drew instead on his imaginings. It began with Sofia disembarking in the Gare du Nord as steam from the locomotive billowed across the platform. Moments later, she was outside the station with her bags in hand, preparing to board the bus with her fellow musicians. Then she was looking out the window at the sights of the city as they drove to the hotel, where the young musicians would remain until their concert—under the watchful gaze of two members of the Conservatory staff, two representatives from VOKS, a cultural attaché, and three “chaperones” in the employ of the KGB. . . . </p>
<p class="calibre1">When the movie returned from Paris to Casablanca, so did the Count. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Setting aside thoughts of his daughter, he followed the action while noting through the corner of his eye Osip’s complete submission to the plights of the principals. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But the Count took particular pleasure in his friend’s engagement during the final minutes of the film. For with the plane to Lisbon in the air and Major Strasser dead on the ground, when Captain Renault frowned at the bottle of Vichy water, dropped it in a wastebasket, and kicked it across the floor, Osip Glebnikov, the former Red Army colonel and high official of the Party, who was sitting on the edge of his seat, poured, frowned, dropped, and kicked. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p419"/><img src="index-419_1.jpg" class="calibre2"/></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3"><b class="calibre4">Antagonists at Arms (And an</b></i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3"><b class="calibre4">Absolution)</b></i></p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre4">G</b>ood evening and welcome to the Boyarsky,” began the Count in Russian, as the middle-aged couple with blond hair and blue eyes looked up from their menus. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Do you speak English?” the husband asked in English, though with a decidedly Scandinavian cadence. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Good evening and welcome to the Boyarsky,” the Count translated accordingly. “My name is Alexander and I will be your waiter tonight. But before describing our specials, may I offer you an aperitif?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I think we are ready to order,” said the husband. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We have just arrived in the hotel after a long day of travel,” explained the wife with a weary smile. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The Count hesitated. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“And where, if I may ask, have you been traveling from . . . ?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Helsinki,” said the husband with a hint of impatience. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well then,  <i class="calibre3">tervetuloa Moskova</i>,” said the Count. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“<i class="calibre3">Kiitos</i>,” replied the wife with a smile. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Given your long journey, I will see to it that you are served a delightful meal without delay. But before I take your order, would you be so kind as to give me your room number . . . ?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">From the beginning, the Count had determined that he would need to filch a few things from a Norwegian, a Dane, a Swede, or a Finn. On the face of it, this task should not have posed a significant challenge, as Scandinavian visitors were reasonably common at the Metropol. The problem was that the visitor in question was sure to notify the hotel’s manager as soon as he discovered that his pocket had been picked, which in turn might lead to the</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p420"/><img src="index-420_1.jpg" class="calibre2"/></p>
<p class="calibre1">notification of authorities, the official interviewing of hotel staff, perhaps even the searching of rooms and the posting of guards at railway stations. </p>
<p class="calibre1">So, the pocket picking would have to take place at the very last minute. In the meantime, the Count could only cross his fingers that a Scandinavian man would be residing in the hotel at the critical juncture. </p>
<p class="calibre1">With grim attention, he had watched as a salesman from Stockholm checked out of the hotel on the thirteenth of June. Then on the seventeenth, a journalist from Oslo had been recalled by his paper. In no small terms, the Count berated himself for not acting sooner. When, lo and behold, with only twenty-four hours to spare, a pair of beleaguered Finns came into the Boyarsky and sat right at his table. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But there remained one small complication: The primary item that the Count hoped to secure was the gentleman’s passport. And as most foreigners in Russia carried their passports about on their person, the Count would not be able to pay a visit to the Finns’ suite on the following morning when they were touring about the city; he would need to visit the suite tonight—while they were in it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As much as we hate to admit the fact, Fate does not take sides. It is fair-minded and generally prefers to maintain some balance between the likelihood of success and failure in all our endeavors. Thus, having put the Count in the challenging position of having to lift a passport at the very last minute, Fate offered the Count a small consolation: for at 9:30, when he asked the Finns if they would like to see the dessert cart, they declined on the grounds that they were exhausted and ready for bed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Shortly after midnight, when the Boyarsky was closed and the Count had bid goodnight to Andrey and Emile, he climbed the stairs to the third floor, went halfway down the hall, took off his shoes, and then by means of Nina’s key slipped into suite 322 in his stocking feet. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Many years before, under a spell cast by a certain actress, the Count had dwelt for a time among the ranks of the invisible. So, as he tiptoed into the Finns’ bedroom, he called upon Venus to veil him in a mist—just as she had for her son, Aeneas, when he wandered the streets of Carthage—so that his</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p421"/>footfalls would be silent, his heartbeat still, and his presence in the room no more notable than a breath of air. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As it was late in June, the Finns had drawn their curtains to block out the glow of the white nights, but a sliver of light remained where the two drapes met. By this narrow illumination, the Count approached the foot of the bed and took in the sleeping forms of the travelers. Thanks be to God, they were about forty years old. Fifteen years younger, they would not have been asleep. Having stumbled back from a late dinner in the Arbat at which they had ordered two bottles of wine, they would now be in each other’s arms. Fifteen years older, they would be tossing and turning, getting up twice a night to visit the loo. But at forty? They had enough appetite to eat well, enough temperance to drink in moderation, and enough wisdom to celebrate the absence of their children by getting a good night’s sleep. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Within a matter of minutes the Count had secured the gentleman’s passport and 150 Finnish marks from the bureau, tiptoed through the sitting room, and slipped back into the hallway, which was empty. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In fact, it was so empty that even his shoes weren’t in it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Confound it,” said the Count to himself. “They must have been picked up by the night service for shining.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">After issuing a litany of self-recriminations, the Count took comfort that in all likelihood on the following morning his shoes would simply be returned by the Finns to the main desk, where they would be cast into the hotel’s collection of unidentifiable misplaced possessions. As he climbed the stairs of the belfry he took additional comfort that all else had gone according to plan.  <i class="calibre3">By this time tomorrow night</i> . . . , he was thinking as he opened his bedroom door—only to discover the Bishop, sitting at the Grand Duke’s desk. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Naturally enough, the Count’s first instinct at the sight was a feeling of indignation. Not only had this accountant of discrepancies, this stripper of wine labels entered the Count’s quarters without invitation, he had actually rested his elbows on that dimpled surface where once had been written persuasive arguments to statesmen and exquisite counsel to friends. The Count was just opening his mouth to demand an explanation, when he saw that a drawer had been opened, and that a sheet of paper was in the Bishop’s hand. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">The letters, </i> the Count realized with a feeling of dread. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p422"/><img src="index-422_1.jpg" class="calibre2"/></p>
<p class="calibre1">Oh, if it had only been the letters. . . . </p>
<p class="calibre1">Carefully written expressions of fondness and fellowship may not have been common between colleagues, but they were hardly suspicious in and of themselves. A man has every right—and some responsibility—to communicate his good feelings to his friends. But it was not one of the recently written letters that the Bishop was holding. It was the first of the <i class="calibre3">Baedeker</i> maps—the one on which the Count had drawn the bright red line connecting the Palais Garnier to the American Embassy by way of the Avenue George V. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Then again, perhaps whether it was a letter or a map mattered not. For when the Bishop had turned at the sound of the door, he had witnessed the transition in the Count’s expression from indignation to horror—a transition that confirmed a state of guilt even before an accusation had been made. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Headwaiter Rostov,” said the Bishop, as if surprised to see the Count in his own room. “You truly are a man of many interests: Wine . . . Cuisine . . . </p>
<p class="calibre1">The streets of Paris . . .” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes,” said the Count while attempting to compose himself. “I have been reading a bit of Proust lately, and thus have been reacquainting myself with the arrangement of the city’s arrondissements.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Of course,” said the Bishop. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Cruelty knows that it has no need of histrionics. It can be as calm and quiet as it likes. It can sigh, or lightly shake its head in disbelief, or offer a sympathetic apology for whatever it must do. It can move slowly, methodically, inevitably. Thus, the Bishop, having gently laid the map on the dimpled surface of the Grand Duke’s desk, now rose from the chair, walked across the room, and slipped past the Count without a word. </p>
<p class="calibre1">What went through the mind of the Bishop as he descended the five flights from the attic to the ground floor? What emotion did he feel? </p>
<p class="calibre1">Perhaps it was gloating. Having felt belittled by the Count for over thirty years, perhaps he now felt the pleasure of finally putting this pretentious polymath in his place. Or perhaps it was righteousness. Maybe comrade Leplevsky was so dedicated to the brotherhood of the Proletariat (from which he’d sprung), that the persistence of this Former Person in the new</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p423"/><img src="index-423_1.jpg" class="calibre2"/></p>
<p class="calibre1">Russia galled his sense of justice. Or maybe it was simply the cold satisfaction of the envious. For those who had difficulty in school or at making friends when they were young will forever recognize with a bitter glance those for whom life has seemed to come easy. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Gloating, righteousness, satisfaction, who can say? But the emotion the Bishop felt upon opening the door to his office was almost certainly that of shock—for the adversary that he had left in the attic just minutes before was now sitting behind the manager’s desk with a pistol in his hand. </p>
<p class="calibre1">How was this possible? </p>
<p class="calibre1">When the Bishop left the Count’s bedroom, the Count was frozen in place by a torrent of emotions—by feelings of fury, incredulity, self-recrimination, and fear. Rather than burn the map, like a fool he had slipped it in his drawer. Six months of the most careful planning and painstaking execution overturned by a single misstep. And what was worse, he had put Sofia at risk. What price was she to pay for his carelessness? </p>
<p class="calibre1">But if the Count was frozen in place, he was frozen for all of five seconds. For these perfectly understandable sentiments, which threatened to drain the blood from his heart, were swept aside by resolve. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Turning on his heels, the Count went to the head of the belfry and listened until the Bishop had descended the first two flights of stairs. Still in his stocking feet, the Count began to follow in the Bishop’s footsteps; but when he got to the fifth floor, he exited the belfry, sped down the hallway, and ran down the main staircase, just as Sofia had at the age of thirteen. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As if he were still enshrouded in a mist, when the Count alit from the stairs, he ran down the hall and entered the executive offices without being seen by a soul; but upon reaching the Bishop’s door, he discovered it was locked. Even as he was taking the Lord’s name in vain, the Count slapped his hands against his vest with relief. For he still had Nina’s passkey in his pocket. Letting himself in, the Count relocked the door and crossed to the wall where the filing cabinets had taken the place of Mr. Halecki’s chaise. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Counting from the portrait of Karl Marx, the Count placed his hand in the center of the second panel to the right, gave a push, and popped it open. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p424"/>Taking the inlaid box from its chamber, the Count set it on the desk and opened the lid. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Simply marvelous,” he said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Then sitting in the manager’s chair, the Count removed the two pistols, loaded them, and waited. He guessed that he had only a matter of seconds before the door would open, but he used them as best he could to moderate his breathing, lower his heart rate, and calm his nerves; such that by the time the Bishop’s key turned in the lock, he was as cold as a killer. </p>
<p class="calibre1">So unanticipated was the Count’s presence behind the desk that the Bishop had swung the door closed before even noticing that he was there. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But if every man has his strengths, one of the Bishop’s was that he was never more than a step away from petty protocol and an inherent sense of superiority. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Headwaiter Rostov,” he said almost peevishly, “you have no business being in this office. I insist that you leave immediately.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The Count raised one of the pistols. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Sit down.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“How dare you!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Sit down,” the Count repeated more slowly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The Bishop would be the first to admit that he had no experience with firearms. In fact, he could barely distinguish between a revolver and a semiautomatic. But any fool could see that what the Count was holding was an antique. A museum piece. A curiosity. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You leave me no choice but to alert the authorities,” he said. Then stepping forward, he took up the receiver from one of his two telephones. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The Count shifted his aim from the Bishop to the portrait of Stalin and shot the former Premier between the eyes. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Shocked by either the sound or the sacrilege, the Bishop jumped back, dropping the receiver with a clatter. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The Count raised the second pistol and leveled it at the Bishop’s chest. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Sit down,” he said again. </p>
<p class="calibre1">This time, the Bishop obliged. </p>
<p class="calibre1">With the second gun still trained on the Bishop’s chest, the Count now stood. He replaced the telephone receiver in its cradle. He backed around the Bishop’s chair and locked the office door. Then he returned to his seat behind the desk. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p425"/>The two men were quiet as the Bishop restored his sense of superiority. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well, Headwaiter Rostov, it seems that by threat of violence, you have succeeded in keeping me against my will. What do you intend to do now?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We’re going to wait.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Wait for what?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The Count didn’t answer. </p>
<p class="calibre1">After a few moments, one of the telephones began to ring. Instinctively, the Bishop reached for it, but the Count shook his head. It rang eleven times before it went silent. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“How long do you expect to hold me here?” insisted the Bishop. “An hour? Two? Until morning?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">It was a good question. The Count looked around the walls of the room for a clock, but couldn’t find one. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Give me your watch,” he said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Excuse me?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You heard me.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The Bishop removed the watch from his wrist and tossed it on the desk. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Generally speaking, the Count was not in favor of relieving men of their possessions at gunpoint, but having prided himself on ignoring the second hand for so many years, the time had come for the Count to attend to it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">According to the Bishop’s watch (which was probably set five minutes fast to ensure that he was never late for work), it was almost 1:00 A.M. </p>
<p class="calibre1">There would still be a few of the hotel’s guests returning from late suppers, a few stragglers in the bar, the clearing and setting up of the Piazza, the vacuuming of the lobby. But by 2:30, the hotel would be quiet in every corner. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Make yourself comfortable,” said the Count. Then to pass the time, he began to whistle a bit of Mozart from  <i class="calibre3">Così fan tutte</i>. Somewhere in the second movement, he became conscious of the fact that the Bishop was smiling dismissively. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Is there something on your mind?” asked the Count. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The left upper corner of the Bishop’s mouth twitched. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Your sort,” he sneered. “How convinced you have always been of the rightness of your actions. As if God Himself was so impressed with your precious manners and delightful way of putting things that He blessed you to do as you pleased. What vanity.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p426"/>The Bishop let out what must have passed in his household for a laugh. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well, you have had your time,” he continued. “You have had your chance to dance with your illusions and act with impunity. But your little orchestra has stopped playing. Whatever you say or do now, whatever you think, even if it is at two or three in the morning behind a locked door, will come to light. And when it does, you will be held to account.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The Count listened to the Bishop with genuine interest and a touch of surprise. His sort? The Lord’s blessing that he could do as he pleased? </p>
<p class="calibre1">While dancing with his illusions? The Count had no idea what the Bishop was talking about. After all, he had now lived under house arrest in the Metropol Hotel for over half his life. He almost smiled, on the verge of making some quip about the large imaginations of small men—but his expression instead grew sober, as he considered the Bishop’s smug assurance that all would “come to light.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">His gaze shifted to the filing cabinets, of which there were now five. </p>
<p class="calibre1">With the barrel of the pistol still trained on the Bishop, the Count crossed to the filing cabinets and pulled at the left uppermost drawer. It was locked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Where is the key?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You have no business opening those cabinets. They contain my personal files.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The Count went around to the back of the desk and opened the drawers. </p>
<p class="calibre1">They were surprisingly empty. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Where would a man like the Bishop keep the key to his personal files? </p>
<p class="calibre1">Why, on his person. Of course. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The Count came around the desk and stood over the Bishop. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You can give me that key,” he said, “or I can take it from you. But there is no third way.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">When the Bishop looked up with an expression of mild indignation, he saw that the Count had raised the old pistol in the air with the clear intention of bringing it down across his face. The Bishop took a small ring of keys from a pocket and threw it on the desk. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Even as they landed in a jangle, the Count could see that the Bishop had undergone something of a transformation. He had suddenly lost his sense of superiority, as if all along it had been secured by his possession of these</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p427"/>keys. Picking up the ring, the Count sorted through them until he found the smallest, then he unlocked all of the Bishop’s filing cabinets one by one. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In the first three cabinets, there was an orderly collection of reports on the hotel’s operations: revenues; occupancy rates; staffing; maintenance expenditures; inventories; and yes, discrepancies. But in the remainder of the cabinets, the files were dedicated to individuals. In addition to files on various guests who had stayed in the hotel over the years, in alphabetical arrangement were files on members of the staff. On Arkady, Vasily, Andrey, and Emile. Even Marina. The Count needed no more than a glance at them to know their purpose. They were a careful accounting of human flaws, noting specific instances of tardiness, impertinence, disaffection, drunkenness, sloth, desire. One could not exactly call the contents of these files spurious or inaccurate. No doubt, all of the aforementioned had been guilty of these human frailties at one point or another; but for any one of them the Count could have compiled a file fifty times larger that cataloged their virtues. Having pulled the files of his friends and dumped them on the desk, the Count returned to the cabinets and double-checked among the Rs. </p>
<p class="calibre1">When he found his own file, he was pleased to discover that it was among the thickest. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The Count looked at his watch (or rather the Bishop’s). It was 2:30 in the morning: the hour of ghosts. The Count reloaded the first pistol, tucked it through his belt, and then pointed the other at the Bishop. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It’s time to go,” he said, then he waved at the files on the desk with the pistol. “They’re your property, you carry them.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The Bishop gathered them up without protest. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Where are we going?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You’ll see soon enough.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The Count led the Bishop through the empty offices, into an enclosed stairwell, and down two flights below street level. </p>
<p class="calibre1">For all his persnickety command of the hotel’s minutiae, the Bishop had obviously never been in the basement. Coming through the door at the bottom of the stairs, he looked around with a mixture of fear and disgust. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“First stop,” the Count said, pulling open the heavy steel door that led into the boiler room. The Bishop hesitated, so the Count poked him with the barrel of the gun. “Over there.” Taking a handkerchief from his pocket, the Count opened the small door in the furnace. “In they go,” he said. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p428"/><img src="index-428_1.jpg" class="calibre2"/></p>
<p class="calibre1">Without a word, the Bishop fed the flames with his files. Perhaps it was his proximity to the furnace, or the exertion of carrying the stack of dossiers down two flights of stairs, but the Bishop had begun to sweat in a manner that was distinctly out of character. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Come on,” said the Count. “Next stop.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Once outside the boiler room, the Count prodded the Bishop down the hall to the cabinet of curiosities. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“There. On the lower shelf. Get that small red book.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The Bishop did as he was told and handed the Count the  <i class="calibre3">Baedeker</i> for Finland. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The Count nodded his head to indicate they were headed farther into the basement. The Bishop now looked quite pale, and after a few steps it seemed his knees might buckle beneath him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Just a little farther,” coaxed the Count. And a moment later they were at the bright blue door. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Taking Nina’s key from his pocket, the Count opened it. “In you go,” he said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The Bishop stepped in and turned. “What are you going to do with me?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’m not going to do anything with you.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Then when are you coming back?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I am never coming back.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You can’t leave me here,” said the Bishop. “It could be weeks before someone finds me!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You attend the daily meeting of the Boyarsky, comrade Leplevsky. If you were listening at the last one, you’d recall that there is a banquet on Tuesday night in the ballroom. I have no doubt that someone will find you then.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">At which point, the Count closed the door and locked the Bishop into that room where pomp bides its time. </p>
<p class="calibre1">They should get along just famously, thought the Count. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It was three in the morning when the Count entered the belfry on the lobby floor. As he climbed, he felt the relief of the narrow escape. Reaching in his pocket, he removed the stolen passport and the Finnish marks and tucked</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p429"/>them in the  <i class="calibre3">Baedeker. </i> But when he turned the corner on the fourth floor, a shiver ran down his spine. For on the landing just above him was the ghost of the one-eyed cat. From his elevated position, the cat looked down upon this Former Person—who was standing there in his stocking feet with pistols in his belt and stolen goods in his hand. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It has been said that Admiral Lord Nelson, having been blinded in one eye during the Battle of the Nile in 1798, three years later during the Battle of Copenhagen held his telescope to his dead eye when his commander raised the signal for retreat—thus continuing his attack until the Danish navy was willing to negotiate a truce. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Though this story was a favorite of the Grand Duke’s and often retold to the young Count as an example of courageous perseverance in the face of impossible odds, the Count had always suspected it was a little apocryphal. </p>
<p class="calibre1">After all, in the midst of armed conflicts, facts are bound to be just as susceptible to injury as ships and men, if not more so. But at the onset of the summer solstice of 1954, the one-eyed cat of the Metropol turned his blind eye upon the Count’s ill-gotten gains, and without the slightest expression of disappointment, disappeared down the stairs. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p430"/> <i class="calibre3"><b class="calibre4">Apotheoses</b></i></p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre4">D</b>espite having gone to bed at four in the morning, on the twenty-first of June the Count rose at his usual hour. He did five squats, five stretches, and took five deep breaths. He breakfasted on coffee, a biscuit, and his daily fruit (today an assortment of berries), after which he went downstairs to read the papers and chat with Vasily. He lunched in the Piazza. In the afternoon, he paid a visit to Marina in the stitching room. As it was his day off, at seven o’clock he had an aperitif at the Shalyapin, where he marveled at the arrival of summer with the ever-attentive Audrius. </p>
<p class="calibre1">And at eight, he dined at table ten in the Boyarsky. Which is to say, he treated the day much as he treated any other. Except that when he left the restaurant at ten, having told Nadja that the manager wished to see her, he slipped inside the empty coatroom in order to borrow the raincoat and fedora of the American journalist, Salisbury. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Back on the sixth floor, the Count dug to the bottom of his old trunk in order to retrieve the rucksack that he had used in 1918 on his trek from Paris to Idlehour. As on that journey, this time he would travel only with the bare necessities. That is, three changes of clothing, a toothbrush and toothpaste,  <i class="calibre3">Anna Karenina</i>, Mishka’s project, and, finally, the bottle of Châteauneuf-du-Pape that he intended to drink on the fourteenth of June 1963—ten years to the day after his old friend’s death. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Gathering up his things, the Count paid one last visit to his study. So many years before, he had bid  <i class="calibre3">adieu</i> to a whole household. Then a few years later he had bid  <i class="calibre3">adieu</i> to a suite. Now, he was to bid  <i class="calibre3">adieu</i> to a room that was one hundred feet square. It was, without question, the smallest room that he had occupied in his life; yet somehow, within those four walls the world had come and gone. With that thought, the Count tipped his hat to Helena’s portrait and switched out the light. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p431"/><img src="index-431_1.jpg" class="calibre2"/></p>
<p class="calibre1">At the same time that the Count was descending to the lobby, Sofia was concluding her performance on the stage of the Salle Pleyel in Paris. Rising from the piano, she turned to the audience almost in a state of wonder—for whenever Sofia performed, she so fully immersed herself in her playing, that she tended to forget there was anyone listening. But having been brought back to her senses by the sound of applause, she did not forget to gesture graciously toward the orchestra and her conductor before taking one final bow. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Immediately offstage, Sofia received a formal congratulations from the cultural attaché and a heartfelt embrace from Director Vavilov. It was her finest performance yet, he said. But then the two men turned their attention back to the stage, where the violin prodigy was taking his place before the conductor. The hall grew so quiet that all assembled could hear the tap of the conductor’s baton. Then after that universal moment of suspension, the musicians began to play and Sofia made her way to the dressing room. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The Conservatory’s orchestra performed Dvorak’s concerto in just over thirty minutes. Sofia would allow herself fifteen to reach the exit. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Taking up her knapsack, she went straight to one of the bathrooms reserved for the musicians. Locking the door behind her, she kicked off her shoes and shed the beautiful blue dress that Marina had made. She took off the necklace that Anna had given her and dropped it on the dress. She donned the slacks and oxford shirt that her father had purloined from the Italian gentleman. Then looking into the small mirror above the sink, she took out the scissors that her father had given her and began to cut her hair. </p>
<p class="calibre1">This little implement in the shape of an egret, which had been so prized by her father’s sister, had clearly been designed for snipping, not shearing. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The rings cut into the knuckles of Sofia’s thumb and forefinger as she tried and failed to cut through lengths of her hair. Beginning to shed tears of frustration, Sofia closed her eyes and took a breath.  <i class="calibre3">There is no time for</i> <i class="calibre3">that</i>, she told herself. Wiping the tears from her cheeks with the back of her hand, she began again—cutting smaller amounts of hair, working systematically around her head. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p432"/><img src="index-432_1.jpg" class="calibre2"/></p>
<p class="calibre1">When she was finished, she swept up the hair with her hands and flushed it down the toilet, just as her father had instructed. Then from a side pocket in the knapsack she took the little black bottle that the barber of the Metropol had once used to dye those first gray hairs that appeared in his customers’ beards. The cap of the bottle had a small brush attached to it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Taking in hand the strip of white hair that had virtually defined her appearance since the age of thirteen, Sofia leaned over the sink and carefully brushed it with the dye until it was as black as the rest of her hair. </p>
<p class="calibre1">When she was done, she returned the bottle and the scissors to her pack. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She took out the Italian’s cap and set it on the sink. Then she shifted her attention to the pile of clothes on the floor—and that is when she realized they had never considered her shoes. All she had was the elegant pair of high-heeled pumps that Anna had helped pick out for the Conservatory competition the year before. With little choice, she dumped them in the trash. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She scooped up the dress and necklace to dispose of them as well. Yes, Marina had made the dress and Anna had given her the necklace, but she couldn’t take them with her—of that, her father had left no doubt. If for any reason she was stopped and her bag was searched, these glamorous feminine items would give her away. Sofia hesitated for a moment, then she stuffed the dress into the trash with the shoes; but the necklace, she slipped into her pocket. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Securing the straps of the knapsack and swinging it onto her back, Sofia pulled the cap tightly onto her head, opened the bathroom door, and listened. The strings were beginning to swell, signaling the end of the third movement. Leaving the bathroom, she turned away from the dressing rooms and headed toward the back of the building. The music grew louder as she passed directly behind the stage. Then with the first notes of the final movement, she passed through the exit at the rear of the hall and went barefoot into the night. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Walking quickly, but not running, Sofia circled the Salle Pleyel to the Rue du Faubourg Saint-Honoré, where the well-lit entrance of the concert hall was located. Crossing the street, she stepped into a doorway and took off</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p433"/>the Italian’s cap. From under the brim, she pulled out the little map that her father had cut from the  <i class="calibre3">Baedeker</i> and folded into the size of a matchbook. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Opening it, she oriented herself and then began following the red line half a block along Faubourg Saint-Honoré, down the Avenue Hoche to the Arc de Triomphe, and then left onto the Champs-Élysées, headed toward the Place de la Concorde. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In drawing this zigzagging line from the doors of the Salle Pleyel to the American Embassy, the Count had not chosen the most direct route. That would have been ten blocks straight along Faubourg Saint-Honoré. But the Count had wanted to get Sofia away from the concert hall as quickly as possible. This slight detour would add only a few minutes to Sofia’s journey, but it would allow her to disappear into the anonymity of the Champs-Élysées; and she should still have enough time to reach the embassy before her absence was discovered. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But when the Count had made this calculation, what he had failed to take into account was the impact upon a twenty-one-year-old girl of seeing the Arc de Triomphe and the Louvre lit up at night for the very first time. </p>
<p class="calibre1">True, Sofia had seen them both the day before, along with plenty of other sights; but just as the Count had imagined, she had seen them through the window of a bus. It was a different thing altogether to see them at the onset of summer, having received an ovation, changed one’s appearance, and escaped into the night. . . . </p>
<p class="calibre1">For while in the classical tradition there was no Muse of architecture, I think we can agree that under the right circumstances, the appearance of a building can impress itself upon one’s memory, affect one’s sentiments, and even change one’s life. Just so, risking minutes that she did not have to spare, Sofia came to a stop at the Place de la Concorde and turned slowly in place, as if in a moment of recognition. </p>
<p class="calibre1">On the night before she had left Moscow, when Sofia had expressed her distress at what her father wanted her to do, he had attempted to console her with a notion. He had said that our lives are steered by uncertainties, many of which are disruptive or even daunting; but that if we persevere and remain generous of heart, we may be granted a moment of supreme lucidity</p>
<p class="calibre1">—a moment in which all that has happened to us suddenly comes into focus as a necessary course of events, even as we find ourselves on the threshold of a bold new life that we had been meant to lead all along. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p434"/><img src="index-434_1.jpg" class="calibre2"/></p>
<p class="calibre1">When her father had made this claim, it had seemed so outlandish, so overblown that it had not assuaged Sofia’s distress in the least. But turning in place on the Place de la Concorde, seeing the Arc de Triomphe, and the Eiffel Tower, and the Tuileries, and the cars and Vespas zipping around the great obelisk, Sofia had an inkling of what her father had been trying to say. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Was it like this all night?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Richard Vanderwhile, who was standing in his apartment in the embassy, had just noticed the angle of his bow tie in the bedroom mirror. It was at a slant of twenty-five degrees. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Your tie is always like that, my dear.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Richard turned to his wife in shock. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Always! Why on earth haven’t you ever said anything?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Because I think it makes you look rakish.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Giving the nod of one who could make do with “rakish,” Richard took another look in the mirror, then pulled the tie loose, hung his tuxedo jacket on the back of his chair, and was about to suggest a nightcap when there was a knock at the door. It was Richard’s attaché. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What is it, Billy?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’m sorry to bother you at this hour, sir. But there is a young man asking for you.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“A young man?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes. Apparently, he is seeking asylum. . . .” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Richard raised his eyebrows. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Asylum from what?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’m not certain, sir. But he isn’t wearing any shoes.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mr. and Mrs. Vanderwhile exchanged looks. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well then, I guess you had better show him in.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The attaché returned a minute later with a young man in a newsboy’s cap who was, in fact, barefoot. In the manner of the polite but anxious, the young man took off his cap and held it at his waist in both hands. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Billy,” said Mrs. Vanderwhile, “this is not a young man.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The attaché’s eyes widened. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well, I’ll be damned,” said Richard. “Sofia Rostov.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p435"/>Sofia smiled with an expression of relief: “Mr. Vanderwhile.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Richard told his attaché he could go, then he approached Sofia with a grin and took her by the elbows. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Let me get a good look at you.” Without letting go of Sofia, Richard turned to his wife. “Didn’t I tell you she was a beauty?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You certainly did,” said Mrs. Vanderwhile with a smile. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Although from Sofia’s perspective, it was Mrs. Vanderwhile who was the beauty. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What a terrific turn of events,” said Richard. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You weren’t . . . expecting me?” asked Sofia tentatively. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Of course we were! But your father has grown quite fond of all this cloak-and-dagger business. He assured me that you were coming, but he wouldn’t let me know when, where, or how. And he certainly didn’t tell me you’d be arriving as a barefoot boy.” Richard pointed to Sofia’s knapsack. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Is that all you brought with you?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’m afraid so.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Are you hungry?” asked Mrs. Vanderwhile. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Before Sofia could respond, Richard chimed in: “Of course she’s hungry. I’m hungry and I’ve just returned from a dinner. I’ll tell you what, my dear: Why don’t you see if you can scare up some clothes for Sofia, while she and I have a chat. Then we can all rendezvous in the kitchen.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">While Mrs. Vanderwhile went in search of clothes, Richard led Sofia into his study and sat on the edge of his desk. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I can’t tell you how excited we are to have you in house, Sofia. And I do so hate putting business before pleasure. But once we sit down to eat, I suspect we’ll be swept away with stories of your adventures. So, before we go to the kitchen, your father mentioned that you might have something for me. . . .” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Sofia looked shy and hesitant. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“My father said that you might have something for me first. . . .” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Richard laughed and slapped his hands together. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Right you are! I’d forgotten all about it.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Richard crossed the room to one of the bookcases. Standing on his tiptoes, he reached to the uppermost shelf and removed what looked like a large book—but which turned out to be a package wrapped in brown paper. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Richard set it down on his desk with a thud. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p436"/>In turn, Sofia began to reach into her knapsack. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Before giving anything to me,” Richard cautioned, “you should probably make sure that this is what it’s supposed to be. . . .” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh, yes. I see.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Besides,” he added, “I’ve been dying of curiosity.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Joining Richard at his desk, Sofia untied the strings and pulled back the folds of paper. Inside was an old edition of Montaigne’s  <i class="calibre3">Essays</i>. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well,” said Richard a little bemused, “you’ve got to give that old Frenchman credit. He’s substantially heavier than Adam Smith or Plato. I really had no idea.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">But then Sofia opened the book, revealing a rectangular cavity cut into the pages, in which there were eight small stacks of gold coins. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Naturally,” said Richard. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Sofia closed the book and retied the strings. Then taking off her knapsack, she emptied its contents onto a chair and handed the empty bag to Richard. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Father said you should cut the seam at the top of the straps.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">There was a knock at the door and Mrs. Vanderwhile poked in her head. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’ve got some clothes to show you, Sofia. Are you ready?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Perfect timing,” said Richard while giving a nod to Sofia. “I’ll follow you in a minute.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Left alone, Richard took a penknife from his pocket. He switched out the blade and carefully cut the seam that had been expertly sewn along the top of the shoulder straps. In the narrow gap that ran behind the length of one of the straps had been slipped a tightly rolled piece of paper. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Easing the roll from its hiding place, Richard sat down and spread it across his desk. On the top side there was a diagram entitled “Combined Dinner of Council of Ministers and Presidium, June 11, 1954.” The diagram itself depicted a long U with forty-six names inscribed around its periphery. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Under the name of each person was their title and a summation of their personality in three words. On the verso was a detailed description of the evening in question. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Certainly, the Count described the announcement concerning the Obninsk nuclear power plant and the theatric display of its connection to the Moscow grid. But what he emphasized in the course of his report were the evening’s social nuances. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p437"/><img src="index-437_1.jpg" class="calibre2"/></p>
<p class="calibre1">First, the Count observed that when the guests appeared at the dinner, virtually all were surprised by the venue. They had obviously arrived at the hotel expecting they would be dining in one of the Boyarsky’s formal rooms, only to be directed instead to suite 417. The one exception was Khrushchev—who entered the room with the cool satisfaction of one who not only knew where the dinner would be held, but was pleased to see that everything was perfectly in order. The General Secretary erased any doubt as to his personal involvement in the planning of the evening when, having been unusually quiet, he stood at ten minutes to eleven to make a toast that referenced the history of the suite two floors below. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But for the Count, the genius of the evening was in Khrushchev’s casual display of his alignment with Malyshev. In recent months, Malenkov had made no secret of his disagreement with Khrushchev regarding nuclear armament. Malenkov foresaw that a nuclear arms race with the West could only have devastating results, referring to it as an “apocalyptic policy.” But with this little event of political theater, Khrushchev had performed the perfect sleight of hand—switching out the threat of nuclear Armageddon for the uplifting sight of a city sparkling with nuclear power. In a stroke, the conservative hawk had cast himself as a man of the future and his progressive opponent as a reactionary. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Sure enough, with the lights of the city shining brightly and freshly chilled bottles of vodka on the table, Malyshev crossed the room to confer with the General Secretary. As most of the others were still milling about with smiles on their faces, Malyshev quite naturally took the empty chair at Khrushchev’s side. So, when everyone began to resume their places, Malenkov found himself stranded behind Khrushchev and Malyshev; and as the Premier of the Communist Party waited awkwardly for them to finish their conversation so that he could reclaim his seat, no one at the table even batted an eye. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As Richard finished reading the Count’s description, he leaned back in his chair and smiled, thinking he could use a hundred men like Alexander Rostov. And that’s when he noticed the small, slightly curled piece of paper lying on his desk. Picking it up, Richard immediately recognized the</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p438"/><img src="index-438_1.jpg" class="calibre2"/></p>
<p class="calibre1">Count’s cursive. The note, which had presumably been rolled up in the report, included a straightforward instruction of how to confirm that Sofia had arrived at the embassy safely, followed by a long sequence of seven-digit numbers. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Richard jumped to his feet. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Billy!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">After a moment the door swung open and the attaché stuck in his head. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Sir?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“If it is almost ten in Paris, what time is it almost in Moscow?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Midnight.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“How many girls are on the switchboard?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’m not certain,” admitted the lieutenant, a little flustered. “At this hour, two; maybe three?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That’s not enough! Go to the typing pool, the decoding room, the kitchen. Round up everyone with a finger on their hand!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">When the Count arrived in the lobby with his rucksack on his shoulder and sat in his chair between the potted palms, he didn’t fidget. He didn’t get up and walk about, or read the evening edition. Nor did he check the time on the Bishop’s watch. </p>
<p class="calibre1">If asked in advance to imagine what sitting there under these circumstances would feel like, the Count would have predicted a definite sense of anxiety. But as the minutes ticked away, the Count didn’t find the wait distressing at all; he found it surprisingly peaceful. With a patience that was almost otherworldly, he watched the guests of the hotel come and go. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He saw the elevator doors open and close. He heard the sound of music and laughter emanating from the Shalyapin Bar. </p>
<p class="calibre1">At that moment, it somehow seemed to the Count that no one was out of place; that every little thing happening was part of some master plan; and that within the context of that plan, he was meant to sit in the chair between the potted palms and wait. And almost exactly at midnight, the Count’s patience was rewarded. For in accordance with the instructions he’d written to Richard, every telephone on the first floor of the Metropol began to ring. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p439"/>All four telephones at the main desk rang. The two house phones that were on a side table by the elevator rang. The telephones at Vasily’s desk and the bell captain’s station rang. As did the four telephones in the Piazza, the three in the coffeehouse, the eight in the executive offices, and the two on the Bishop’s desk. All told, there must have been thirty phones ringing at once. </p>
<p class="calibre1">What a simple thing in concept, the simultaneous ringing of thirty phones. And yet, it immediately created a sense of pandemonium. Those who were in the lobby began looking from corner to corner. What could bring about the ringing of thirty phones at twelve o’clock at night? Had the Metropol been struck by lightning? Was Russia under attack? Or were the spirits of the past exacting their toll on the present? </p>
<p class="calibre1">Whatever the cause, the sound was utterly disconcerting. </p>
<p class="calibre1">When a single telephone rings, our immediate instinct is to pick up the receiver and say hello. But when thirty ring at once, our instinct is to take two steps back and stare. The limited crew of the night shift found themselves running from phone to phone without the fortitude to answer a single one. The drunken crowd in the Shalyapin began spilling into the lobby, as guests, who had been awakened on the second floor, came marching down the stairs. And in the midst of this commotion, Count Alexander Ilyich Rostov quietly donned the journalist’s hat and coat, shouldered his rucksack, and walked out of the Metropol Hotel. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p440"/><img src="index-440_1.jpg" class="calibre2"/></p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre4">AFTERWORD</b></p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p441"/> <i class="calibre3"><b class="calibre4">Afterwards . . . </b></i></p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre4">O</b>n the twenty-first of June 1954, Viktor Stepanovich Skadovsky left his apartment shortly before midnight in order to keep an appointment. </p>
<p class="calibre1">His wife had urged him not to go. What good could come from an appointment at this hour, she wanted to know. Did he think the police didn’t walk the streets at midnight? The police  <i class="calibre3">made a point </i> of walking the streets at midnight. Because since the beginning of time, that’s when fools have kept their appointments! </p>
<p class="calibre1">Viktor responded to his wife that this was nonsense; that she was being melodramatic. But when he left their building, he walked ten blocks to the Garden Ring before boarding a bus, and he took comfort from the indifference with which the others on the bus received him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Yes, his wife was upset that he had an appointment at midnight. But if she had known the purpose of the appointment, she would have been beside herself. And if, upon learning of his intentions, she had demanded to know why on earth he had agreed to do something so foolhardy, he wouldn’t have been able to answer her. He wasn’t certain himself. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It wasn’t simply because of Sofia. Of course, he felt an almost fatherly pride in her achievement as a pianist. The very notion of helping a young artist discover her talent was a fantasy that Viktor had long since abandoned; and to experience it so unexpectedly was beyond description. </p>
<p class="calibre1">What’s more, it was the hours of teaching Sofia that had ultimately led him to pursue another abandoned dream: playing the classical repertoire in a chamber orchestra. But even so, it wasn’t simply because of her. </p>
<p class="calibre1">To a greater degree, it was because of the Count. For, however unaccountably, Viktor felt a profound sense of loyalty to Alexander Ilyich Rostov; a sense of loyalty that was grounded in feelings of respect that Viktor could hardly articulate—and that his wife, for all her virtues, would never have understood. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p442"/><img src="index-442_1.jpg" class="calibre2"/></p>
<p class="calibre1">But perhaps most of all, he had agreed to the Count’s request because it felt right to do so; and that feeling of conviction, in itself, was a pleasure that had become increasingly rare. </p>
<p class="calibre1">With that thought, Viktor stepped off the bus, entered the old St. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Petersburg Station, and walked across the central hall toward the brightly lit café where he had been instructed to wait. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Viktor was sitting in a booth in the corner—watching an old accordion player move from table to table—when the Count entered the café. He was wearing an American trench coat and a dark gray fedora. Seeing Viktor, he crossed the café, set down his rucksack, shed the coat and hat, and joined him in the booth. When a moment later the waitress appeared, he ordered a cup of coffee and then waited for the coffee to arrive before sliding a little red book across the table. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I want to thank you for doing this,” he said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You needn’t thank me, Your Excellency.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Please, Viktor. Call me Alexander.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Viktor was about to ask if the Count had received any word from Sofia, but he was interrupted by a scuffle on the other side of the café. Two haggard-looking fruit sellers carrying woven baskets had gotten into a territorial dispute. Given that it was so late, both men were down to a few sorry pieces of produce; and while this may have lent an air of futility to their argument in the eyes of the observers, it in no way diminished the stakes for the principals. To that end, after a brief exchange of insults, one struck the other in the face. With blood on his lip and fruit on the floor, the assaulted man responded in kind. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As the customers in the café stopped their conversations to watch the skirmish with weary, knowing expressions, the café’s manager rounded the bar and dragged the combatants out by their collars. For a moment, the room was silent while everyone stared out the café window to the spot where the two fruit sellers remained sitting on the ground a few feet apart. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Then all of a sudden, the old accordion player—who had stopped performing during the scuffle—struck up a friendly tune, presumably in the hopes of restoring some sense of goodwill. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p443"/><img src="index-443_1.jpg" class="calibre2"/></p>
<p class="calibre1">As Viktor took a sip from his coffee, the Count watched the accordion player with interest. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Have you ever seen  <i class="calibre3">Casablanca</i>?” he asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Somewhat bewildered, Viktor admitted that he had not. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Ah. You must see it one day.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">And so the Count told Viktor about his friend Osip and their recent viewing of the movie. In particular, he described the scene in which a small-time crook was dragged away by the police and how the American saloonkeeper, having assured his customers that everything was all right, casually instructed his bandleader to play on. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“My friend was very impressed with this,” explained the Count. “He saw the saloonkeeper’s instruction to the piano player to start playing so soon after the arrest as evidence of his indifference to the fates of other men. But I wonder. . . .” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The following morning at half past eleven, two officers of the KGB arrived at the Metropol Hotel in order to question Headwaiter Alexander Rostov on an undisclosed matter. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Having been escorted by a bellhop to Rostov’s room on the sixth floor, the officers found no sign of him there. Nor was he receiving a trim in the barbershop, lunching at the Piazza, or reading the papers in the lobby. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Several of Rostov’s closest associates, including Chef Zhukovsky and Maître d’ Duras, were questioned, but none had seen Rostov since the previous night. (The officers also endeavored to speak with the hotel’s manager, only to find that he had not yet reported to work—a fact that was duly noted in his file!) At one o’clock, two additional KGB men were summoned so that a more thorough search could be made of the hotel. At two, the senior officer conducting the investigation was encouraged to speak with Vasily, the concierge. Finding him at his desk in the lobby (where he was in the midst of securing theater tickets for a guest), the officer did not beat about the bush. He put his question to the concierge unambiguously:</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Do you know the whereabouts of Alexander Rostov?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">To which the concierge replied: “I haven’t the slightest idea.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p444"/><img src="index-444_1.jpg" class="calibre2"/></p>
<p class="calibre1">Having learned that both Manager Leplevsky and Headwaiter Rostov had gone missing, Chef Zhukovsky and Maître d’ Duras convened at 2:15 for their daily meeting in the chef’s office, where they immediately engaged in close conversation. To be perfectly frank, there was little time spent on consideration of Manager Leplevsky’s absence. But there was a good deal of time spent on Headwaiter Rostov’s. . . . </p>
<p class="calibre1">Initially concerned when they had received word of their friend’s disappearance, the two members of the Triumvirate took comfort from the KGB’s obvious frustration—for it confirmed that the Count was not in their grips. But the question remained:  <i class="calibre3">Where could he possibly be? </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">Then a certain rumor began to spread among the hotel’s staff. For though the officers of the KGB were trained to be inscrutable, gestures, language, and facial expressions have a fundamentally unruly syntax. Thus, over the course of the morning, implications had slipped out and inferences had been made that Sofia had gone missing in Paris. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Is it possible . . . ?” wondered Andrey aloud, clearly implying to Emile that their friend may also have escaped into the night. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As it was only 2:25, and Chef Zhukovsky had yet to turn the corner from pessimist to optimist, he curtly replied: “Of course not!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">This led to a debate between the two men on the differences between what was probable, plausible, and possible—a debate that might have gone on for an hour, but for a knock at the door. Responding with an irritated</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes?” Emile turned, expecting to find Ilya with his wooden spoon, but it was the clerk from the mail room. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The chef and maître d’ were so confounded by his sudden appearance that they simply stared. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Are you Chef Zhukovsky and Maître d’ Duras?” he asked after a moment. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Of course we are!” declared the chef. “Who else would we be?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Without a word, the clerk presented two of the five envelopes that had been dropped in his slot the night before (having already made visits to the seamstress’s office, the bar, and the concierge’s desk). A professional through and through, the clerk showed no curiosity as to the contents of</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p445"/><img src="index-445_1.jpg" class="calibre2"/></p>
<p class="calibre1">these letters despite their unusual weight; and he certainly didn’t wait around for them to be opened, having plenty of his own work to attend to, thank you very much. </p>
<p class="calibre1">With the mail clerk’s departure, Emile and Andrey looked down at their respective envelopes in wonder. In an instant, they could see that the letters had been addressed in a script that was at once proper, proud, and openhearted. Meeting each other’s gaze, they raised their eyebrows then tore the envelopes open. Inside, they each found a letter of parting that thanked them for their fellowship, assured them that the Night of the Bouillabaisse would never be forgotten, and asked that they accept the enclosed as a small token of undying friendship. The “enclosed” happened to be four gold coins. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The two men, who had opened their letters at the same time, and read them at the same time, now dropped them on the table at the same time. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It’s true!” gasped Emile. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A man of discretion and civility, Andrey did not for one second consider saying:  <i class="calibre3">I told you so. </i> Although with a smile he did observe: “So it seems . . .” </p>
<p class="calibre1">But when Emile had recovered from these happy surprises (four pieces of gold  <i class="calibre3">and</i> an old friend purposefully at large!), he shook his head as one forlorn. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What is it?” asked Andrey in concern. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“With Alexander gone and you afflicted with palsy,” the chef said, </p>
<p class="calibre1">“what is to become of me?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Andrey looked at the chef for a moment then smiled. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Afflicted with palsy! My friend, my hands are as agile as they have ever been.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Then to prove his point, Andrey picked up the four gold Catherines and sent them spinning in the air. </p>
<p class="calibre1">At five o’clock that afternoon, in a nicely appointed office of the Kremlin (with a view of the lilacs in the Alexander Gardens, no less), the Chief Administrator of a special branch of the country’s elaborate security apparatus sat behind his desk reviewing a file. Dressed in a dark gray suit, </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p446"/>the Chief Administrator might have been described as relatively indistinguishable when compared to any other balding bureaucrat in his early sixties, were it not for the scar above his left ear where, by all appearances, someone had once attempted to cleave his skull. </p>
<p class="calibre1">When there was a knock at his door, the Chief Administrator called, </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Come in.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The knocker was a young man in a shirt and tie bearing a thick brown folder. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes?” said the Chief Administrator to his lieutenant, while not looking up from his work. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Sir,” the lieutenant replied. “Word was received early this morning that a student on the Moscow Conservatory’s goodwill tour has gone missing in Paris.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The Chief Administrator looked up. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“A student from the Moscow Conservatory?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes, sir.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Male or female?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“A young woman.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">. . . </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What is her name?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The lieutenant consulted the folder in his hands. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Her given name is Sofia and she resides in the Metropol Hotel, where she has been raised by one Alexander Rostov, a Former Person under house arrest; although there appears to be some question as to her paternity. . . .” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I see. . . . And has this Rostov been questioned?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That is just it, sir. Rostov cannot be found either. An initial search of the hotel’s premises proved fruitless, and no one who has been questioned has admitted to seeing him since last night. However, a second and more thorough search this afternoon resulted in the discovery of the hotel’s manager, locked in a storeroom in the basement.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Not comrade Leplevsky . . .” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The very same, sir. It appears that he discovered the plan of the girl’s defection and was on his way to inform the KGB when Rostov overcame him and forced him into the storeroom at gunpoint.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“At gunpoint!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes, sir.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p447"/>“Where did Rostov get a firearm?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It appears that he had a pair of antique dueling pistols—and the will to use them. In fact, it has been confirmed that he shot a portrait of Stalin in the manager’s office.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Shot a portrait of Stalin. Well. He does sound like a rather ruthless fellow. . . .” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes, sir. And, if I may say so, wily. For it appears that two nights ago a Finnish passport and Finnish currency were stolen from one of the hotel’s Finnish guests. Then last night, a raincoat and hat were stolen from an American journalist. This afternoon, investigators were sent to Leningradsky Railway Station, where confirmation was obtained that a man wearing the hat and coat in question was seen boarding the overnight train to Helsinki. The hat and coat were discovered in a washroom at the Russian terminus in Vyborg, along with a travel guide for Finland from which the maps had been removed. Given the tightness of security at the railway crossing into Finland, it is presumed that Rostov disembarked in Vyborg in order to cross the border on foot. Local security has been alerted, but he may already have slipped through their fingers.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I see . . . ,” said the Chief Administrator again, accepting the file from his lieutenant and putting it on his desk. “But tell me, how did we make the connection between Rostov and the Finnish passport in the first place?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Comrade Leplevsky, sir.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“How so?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“When comrade Leplevsky was led to the basement, he witnessed Rostov taking the Finnish guide from a collection of abandoned books. </p>
<p class="calibre1">With that piece of information in hand, the connection was quickly made to the theft of the passport, and officers were dispatched to the station.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Excellent work all around,” said the Chief Administrator. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes, sir. Though it does make one wonder.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Wonder what?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Why Rostov didn’t shoot Leplevsky when he had the chance.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Obviously,” said the Chief Administrator, “he didn’t shoot Leplevsky, because Leplevsky isn’t an aristocrat.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Sir?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh, never mind.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p448"/><img src="index-448_1.jpg" class="calibre2"/></p>
<p class="calibre1">As the Chief Administrator tapped the new folder with his fingers, the lieutenant lingered in the doorway. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes? Is there something else?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No, sir. There is nothing else. But how shall we proceed?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The Chief Administrator considered this question for a moment and then, leaning back in his chair with the barest hint of a smile, replied:</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Round up the usual suspects.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">It was Viktor Stepanovich, of course, who left the damning evidence in the Vyborg terminal washroom. </p>
<p class="calibre1">An hour after bidding the Count good-bye, he boarded the Helsinki-bound train wearing the journalist’s hat and coat with the  <i class="calibre3">Baedeker</i> in his pocket. When he disembarked in Vyborg, he tore out the maps and left the guide with the other items on a counter in the station’s washroom. Then he traveled back on the next train bound for Moscow empty-handed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It was almost a year later when Viktor finally had the opportunity to watch  <i class="calibre3">Casablanca</i>. Naturally, when the scene shifted to Rick’s Café and the police began closing in on Ugarte, his interest was piqued, because he remembered his conversation with the Count in the railway station café. So with utmost attention, he watched as Rick disregarded Ugarte’s pleas for help; he saw the saloonkeeper’s expression remain cool and aloof when the police dragged Ugarte from his lapels; but then, as Rick began making his way through the disconcerted crowd toward the piano player, something caught Viktor’s eye. Just the slightest detail, not more than a few frames of film: In the midst of this short journey, as Rick passes a customer’s table, without breaking stride or interrupting his assurances to the crowd, he sets upright a cocktail glass that had been knocked over during the skirmish. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Yes, thought Viktor, that’s it, exactly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">For here was Casablanca, a far-flung outpost in a time of war. And here at the heart of the city, right under the sweep of the searchlights, was Rick’s Café Américain, where the beleaguered could assemble for the moment to gamble and drink and listen to music; to conspire, console, and most importantly, hope. And at the center of this oasis was Rick. As the Count’s friend had observed, the saloonkeeper’s cool response to Ugarte’s arrest and</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p449"/>his instruction for the band to play on could suggest a certain indifference to the fates of men. But in setting upright the cocktail glass in the aftermath of the commotion, didn’t he also exhibit an essential faith that by the smallest of one’s actions one can restore some sense of order to the world? </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p450"/> <i class="calibre3"><b class="calibre4">And Anon</b></i></p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre4">O</b>n one of the first afternoons of summer in 1954, a tall man in his sixties stood in the high grass among some ragged apple trees somewhere in the Nizhny Novgorod Province. The beginnings of a beard on his chin, the dirt on his boots, and the rucksack on his back all contributed to the impression that the man had been hiking for several days, though he didn’t look weary from the effort. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pausing among the trees, the traveler looked a few paces ahead to where he could just make out the suggestion of a road that had become overgrown long ago. As the man turned onto this old road with a smile at once wistful and serene, a voice came down from the heavens to ask:  <i class="calibre3">Where are you</i> <i class="calibre3">going? </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">Stopping in his tracks, the man looked up as—with a rustle of branches</p>
<p class="calibre1">—a boy of ten dropped to the ground from an apple tree. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The eyes of the old man widened. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You’re as silent as a mouse, young man.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">With a look of self-assurance, the boy took the man’s remark very much as a compliment. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I am too,” said a timid voice from among the leaves. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The traveler looked up to discover a girl of seven or eight perched on a branch. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Indeed, you are! Would you like a hand coming down?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I don’t need one,” said the girl. But she angled herself to drop into the traveler’s arms, just the same. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Once the girl was on the ground beside the boy, the traveler could see that the two were siblings. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We’re pirates,” the boy said matter-of-factly, while looking off toward the horizon. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I could tell,” said the man. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Are you going to the mansion?” the little girl asked with curiosity. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p451"/><img src="index-451_1.jpg" class="calibre2"/></p>
<p class="calibre1">“Most no one goes there,” cautioned the boy. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Where is it?” the man asked, having seen no sign of it through the trees. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We’ll show you.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The boy and girl led the man along the old, overgrown road, which turned in a long, lazy arc. After they had walked about ten minutes, the mystery of the mansion’s invisibility was solved: for having been burned to the ground decades before, it consisted now of two tilting chimneys at either end of a clearing still dusted here and there with ash. </p>
<p class="calibre1">If one has been absent for decades from a place that one once held dear, the wise would generally counsel that one should never return there again. </p>
<p class="calibre1">History abounds with sobering examples: After decades of wandering the seas and overcoming all manner of deadly hazards, Odysseus finally returned to Ithaca, only to leave it again a few years later. Robinson Crusoe, having made it back to England after years of isolation, shortly thereafter set sail for that very same island from which he had so fervently prayed for deliverance. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Why after so many years of longing for home did these sojourners abandon it so shortly upon their return? It is hard to say. But perhaps for those returning after a long absence, the combination of heartfelt sentiments and the ruthless influence of time can only spawn disappointments. The landscape is not as beautiful as one remembered it. The local cider is not as sweet. Quaint buildings have been restored beyond recognition, while fine old traditions have lapsed to make way for mystifying new entertainments. </p>
<p class="calibre1">And having imagined at one time that one resided at the very center of this little universe, one is barely recognized, if recognized at all. Thus do the wise counsel that one should steer far and wide of the old homestead. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But no counsel, however well grounded in history, is suitable for all. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Like bottles of wine, two men will differ radically from each other for being born a year apart or on neighboring hills. By way of example, as this traveler stood before the ruins of his old home, he was not overcome by shock, indignation, or despair. Rather, he exhibited the same smile, at once wistful and serene, that he had exhibited upon seeing the overgrown road. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p452"/><img src="index-452_1.jpg" class="calibre2"/></p>
<p class="calibre1">For as it turns out, one can revisit the past quite pleasantly, as long as one does so expecting nearly every aspect of it to have changed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Having wished the young pirates well, our traveler made his way into the local village about five miles away. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Though he didn’t mind seeing that so many of the old landmarks had disappeared, he was greatly relieved to find that the inn at the edge of town was still there. Ducking his head as he came through the front door and taking his rucksack from his shoulder, he was greeted by the innkeeper—a middle-aged woman who appeared from the back wiping her hands on her apron. She asked if he was looking for a room. He confirmed that he was, but said he’d like to have something to eat first. So she gestured with her head toward the doorway that led to the tavern. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ducking his head again, he went inside. Given the hour, there were but a few citizens seated here and there at the old wooden tables, eating a simple stew of cabbage and potatoes, or drinking a glass of vodka. Offering a friendly nod to those who bothered to look up from their meals, the man headed to the little room with the old Russian stove at the back of the tavern. And there in the corner, at a table for two, her hair tinged with gray, the willowy woman waited. </p>

Thus did the typewriters clack through the night, until that historic document had been crafted which guaranteed for all Russians freedom of conscience (Article 13), freedom of expression (Article 14), freedom of assembly (Article 15), and freedom to have any of these rights revoked should they be “utlitized to the detriment of the socialist revolution” (Article 23)! </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p455"/><a href="index_split_001.html#p105">*Among readers of European fiction, the character names in Russian novels are notorious for</a></p>
<p class="calibre1">their difficulty. Not content to rely on given and family names, we Russians like to make use of honorifics, patronymics, and an array of diminutives—such that a single character in one of our novels may be referred to in four different ways in as many pages. To make matters worse, it seems that our greatest authors, due to some deep-rooted sense of tradition or a complete lack of imagination, constrained themselves to the use of thirty given names. You cannot pick up a work of Tolstoy, Dostoevsky, or Turgenev without bumping into an Anna, an Andrey, or an Alexander. Thus it must be with some trepidation that our Western reader meets any new character in a Russian novel</p>
<p class="calibre1">—knowing that in the remote chance this character plays an important role in future chapters, he must now stop and commit the name to memory. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As such, I think it only fair to inform you now that while Prince Nikolai Petrov has agreed to meet the Count on Saturday night for a drink, he will not be keeping the appointment. </p>
<p class="calibre1">For when the quartet finishes their engagement at midnight, young Prince Nikolai will button his overcoat, tighten his scarf, and walk to his family’s residence on Pushkin Square. Needless to say, when he arrives at 12:30, there are no footmen to greet him. With his violin in hand, he mounts the staircase headed toward the room on the fourth floor that has been left to his use. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Though the house seems empty, on the second floor Nikolai comes upon two of the house’s newer residents smoking cigarettes. Nikolai recognizes one of them as the middle-aged woman who now lives in the nursery. The other is the bus operator with a family of four who lives in his mother’s boudoir. When the Prince wishes them a goodnight with the unassuming smile of the house, neither says a word. But when he reaches the fourth floor he understands their reticence and can hardly blame them. For standing in the hallway are three men from the Cheka waiting to search his room. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Upon seeing them, Prince Nikolai does not make a scene or voice some idle protest. After all, it is the third time they have searched his room in six months, and he even recognizes one of the fellows. </p>
<p class="calibre1">So, familiar with the procedure and weary from a long day, he offers them the same unassuming smile, lets them inside, and sits at the little table by the window as they go about their business. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The Prince has nothing to hide. Just sixteen years old when the Hermitage fell, he has never read a tract or harbored a grudge. If you asked him to play the imperial anthem, he wouldn’t remember how. He even sees some sense in his grand old house being divvied up. His mother and sisters in Paris, his grandparents dead, the family servants scattered to the winds, what was he going to do with thirty rooms? All he really needed was a bed, a washbasin, and a chance to work. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But at two in the morning, the Prince is awakened with a shove by the officer in charge. In his hands is a textbook—a Latin grammar from Nikolai’s days at the Imperial Lyceum. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Is it yours?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">There is no point in lying. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes,” he says. “I attended the academy when I was a boy.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The officer opens the book; and there on the front plate looking regal and wise is a picture of Tsar Nicholas II—the possession of which is a crime. The Prince has to laugh, for he had taken such pains to remove all portraits, crests, and royal insignia from his room. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The captain slices the page out of the grammar with the blade of a knife. He marks the back with the time and place and has the Prince undersign it. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p456"/>The Prince is taken to the Lubyanka, where he is held for several days and questioned once again regarding his loyalties. On the fifth day, all things considered, Fate spares him. For he is not ushered to the courtyard and put against the wall; nor is he shipped off to Siberia. He is merely given a Minus Six: the administrative sentence that allows him to roam Russia at will, as long as he never sets foot in Moscow, St. Petersburg, Kiev, Kharkov, Yekaterinburg, and Tibilisi—that is, the country’s six largest cities. </p>
<p class="calibre1">About fifty miles from Moscow in Tuchkovo, the young Prince resumes his life; and for the most part, he does so without resentment, indignation, or nostalgia. In his new hometown, the grass still grows, the fruit trees blossom, and young women come of age. In addition, by virtue of his remoteness, he is spared the knowledge that one year after his sentence, a trio of Cheka will be waiting for his old instructor when he comes home to the small apartment where he lives with his aging wife. When they haul him before a troika, what seals his fate and sends him to the camps is evidence that on multiple occasions he had hired Former Person Nikolai Petrov to play in his quartet despite a clear prohibition against doing so. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But having said that you needn’t bother to remember the name of Prince Petrov, I should note that despite the brief appearance of the round-faced fellow with a receding hairline a chapter hence, he is someone you should commit to memory, for years later he will have great bearing on the outcome of this tale. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p457"/><a href="index_split_001.html#p114">*Why</a>,  <i class="calibre3">especially</i> the street sweepers! </p>
<p class="calibre1">Those unsung few who rise at dawn and trod the empty avenues gathering up the refuse of the era. Not simply the matchbooks, candy wrappers, and ticket stubs, mind you; but the newspapers, journals, and pamphlets; the catechisms and hymnals, histories and memoirs; the contracts, deeds, and titles; the treaties and constitutions and all Ten Commandments. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Sweep on, street sweepers! Sweep until the cobblestones of Russia glitter like gold! </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p458"/><a href="index_split_002.html#p175">*Established in 1923, the OGPU replaced the Cheka as Russia’</a>s cental organ of the secret police. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In 1934, the OGPU would be replaced by the NKVD, which in turn would be replaced by the MGB</p>
<p class="calibre1">in 1943 and the KGB in 1954. On the surface, this may seem confusing. But the good news is that unlike political parties, artistic movements, or schools of fashion—which go through such sweeping reinventions—the methodologies and intentions of the secret police never change. So you should feel no need to distinguish one acronym from the next. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p459"/><a href="index_split_003.html#p190">*In those early years of the Soviet Union, how did the Bolsheviks countenance the idea of gilded</a></p>
<p class="calibre1">chairs and Louis Quatorze dressers in the mansions of starlets? For that matter, how did they stomach them in their own apartments? Simple. Nailed to the bottom of every piece of fine furniture was a small copper plate embossed with a number. This number served to identify the piece as part of the vast inventory of the People. Thus, a good Bolshevik could sleep soundly in the knowledge that the mahogany bed he was lying on was not his; and despite the fact that his apartment was furnished with priceless antiques, he had fewer possessions than a pauper! </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p460"/><a href="index_split_003.html#p212">*Y</a>es, this little gray fellow behind his little gray desk was charged not only with recording the information the waitresses gathered, but with ensuring their willing participation by reminding them of their duty to their country, by suggesting how easy it would be for them to lose their positions, and, when necessary, by making some other more ominous innuendo. But let us not condemn the fellow too quickly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">For he has never been to the Shalyapin Bar. Nor has he dined at the Boyarsky. He has been allotted a vicarious life—a life in which all experiences are at arm’s length, all sensations secondhand. No bleat of the trumpet, no clink of the glass, no sight of a young woman’s knee for him. Like a scientist’s assistant, his lot was simply to record the data and then relay a summary to his superiors without embellishment or elaboration. </p>
<p class="calibre1">To be fair, he was no slouch in this endeavor and was even known throughout his department as something of a prodigy. For no one in all of Moscow could write a report to such drab perfection. </p>
<p class="calibre1">With limited instruction, he had perfected the art of withholding his insights, forgoing his witticisms, curbing the use of metaphors, similes, and analogies—in essence, exercising every muscle of poetic restraint. In fact, if the reporters whom he was dutifully transcribing had only seen his handiwork, they would have taken off their hats, bowed their heads, and acknowledged that here was a master of objectivity. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p461"/><a href="index_split_003.html#p225">*While many of the young loyalists (like Nina) who joined the </a> <i class="calibre3">udarniks</i> in the countryside would have their faith in the Party tested by what they witnessed, most of Russia, and for that matter the world, would be spared the spectacle of this man-made disaster. For just as peasants from the countryside were forbidden to enter the cities, journalists from the cities were forbidden to enter the countryside; delivery of personal mail was suspended; and the windows of passenger trains were blackened. In fact, so successful was the campaign to contain awareness of the crisis, when word leaked out that millions were starving in Ukraine, Walter Duranty, the lead correspondent for  <i class="calibre3">The</i> <i class="calibre3">New York Times</i> in Russia (and one of the ringleaders in the Shalyapin Bar), would report that these rumors of famine were grossly exaggerated and had probably originated with anti-Soviet propagandists. Thus, the world would shrug. And even as the crime unfolded, Duranty would win the Pulitzer Prize. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p462"/><a href="index_split_003.html#p227">*T</a>rue, there was still one more purge to see to, but this one was to be directed at high Party officials and members of the secret police. In fact, Genrikh Yagoda, the dreaded head of the NKVD, was about to get his. Accused of treason, conspiracy, and diamond smuggling, Yagoda would be tried publicly in the Palace of Unions—right across the square from the Metropol Hotel—found guilty, and summarily shot. So, this too would be regarded by many as a harbinger of brighter days. . . . </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p463"/><a href="index_split_004.html#p286">*Stripped of their names and family ties, of their professions and possessions, herded together in</a></p>
<p class="calibre1">hunger and hardship, the residents of the Gulag—the  <i class="calibre3">zeks</i>—became indistinguishable from one another. That, of course, was part of the point. Not content with the toll exacted by means of incarceration and forced labor in inhospitable climes, the supreme authorities sought to  <i class="calibre3">efface</i> the Enemies of the People. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But an unanticipated consequence of this strategy was the creation of a new polis. Having been stripped of their identities, henceforth the  <i class="calibre3">zeks</i>—though millions in number—would move in perfect unison, sharing in their privations as well as their will to persist. Henceforth, they would know each other whenever and wherever they met. They would make room for each other under their roofs and at their tables, addressing each other as  <i class="calibre3">brother</i> and  <i class="calibre3">sister</i> and  <i class="calibre3">friend</i>; but never, ever, under any circumstance, as  <i class="calibre3">comrade</i>. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p464"/><a href="index_split_004.html#p325">*What sort of topsy-turvy circumstances could lead to a boom for builders and a bust for</a></p>
<p class="calibre1">architects? Simple:</p>
<p class="calibre1">In January, the mayor of Moscow had called a convention of the city’s architects to discuss the needs of the capital given the rapid growth in its population. Over the course of three days, an excited consensus had quickly formed across the various committees that the time had come for bold new steps. Taking advantage of the latest materials and technologies, they proposed that the city erect towers forty stories high with elevators that shot from the lobby to the roof, and apartments that could be configured to suit every individual need, each with a modern kitchen and private bath and plate-glass windows emitting natural light! </p>
<p class="calibre1">At the closing ceremony of the convention, the mayor—a bald and brutish sort, whom we will have reason to revisit later—thanked the attendees for their artistry, their ingenuity, and their dedication to the Party. “It is satisfying to discover that we are all in agreement,” he concluded. “In order to house our fellow comrades as quickly and economically as possible, we must, indeed, pursue bold new steps. So, let us not get bogged down with elaborate designs or bow to aesthetic vanities. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Let us apply ourselves instead to a universal ideal that is fitting for our times.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Thus was born the golden age of the prefabricated, cement-walled, five-story apartment building</p>
<p class="calibre1">—and the four-hundred-square-foot living spaces with ready access to communal bathrooms boasting four-foot tubs (after all, who has time to lie down in a bath when your neighbors are knocking at the door). </p>
<p class="calibre1">So ingenious was the design of these new apartment buildings, so intuitive their architecture, they could be built from a single page of specifications—regardless of which way the page was oriented! </p>
<p class="calibre1">Within six months, thousands of them had sprung up on the outskirts of Moscow, like mushrooms after a rain. And so systematic was their realization, you could mistakenly enter any apartment on your block and feel immediately at home. </p>

Where were the other two at the time of this dinner? Lazar Kaganovich, a fine old Stalinist in the iron-fisted mold, had been sent on an administrative mission to Ukraine. Within a few years, he would be presiding over a potassium factory a thousand miles from Moscow. But at least he fared better than Lavrentiy Beria. The former head of the secret police, who many Western observers thought well positioned to inherit the throne when Stalin died, instead was decorated by the Party with a pistol shot to the head. And then there were six. </p>
