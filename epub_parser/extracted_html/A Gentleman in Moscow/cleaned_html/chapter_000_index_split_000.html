<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre4">APPEARANCE OF COUNT ALEXANDER ILYICH ROSTOV</b></p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre4">BEFORE THE EMERGENCY COMMITTEE OF THE PEOPLE’S COMMISSARIAT FOR INTERNAL AFFAIRS</b></p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre4">Presiding: Comrades V. A. Ignatov, M. S. Zakovsky, A. N. Kosarev</b> <b class="calibre4">Prosecuting: A. Y. Vyshinsky</b></p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre4">Prosecutor Vyshinsky: State your name. </b></p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre4">Rostov: Count Alexander Ilyich Rostov, recipient of the Order of Saint Andrew,</b> <b class="calibre4">member of the Jockey Club, Master of the Hunt. </b></p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre4">Vyshinsky: You may have your titles; they are of no use to anyone else. But for the</b> <b class="calibre4">record, are you not Alexander Rostov, born in St. Petersburg, 24 October 1889? </b></p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre4">Rostov: I am he. </b></p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre4">Vyshinsky: Before we begin, I must say, I do not think that I have ever seen a</b> <b class="calibre4">jacket festooned with so many buttons. </b></p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre4">Rostov: Thank you. </b></p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre4">Vyshinsky: It was not meant as a compliment. </b></p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre4">Rostov: In that case, I demand satisfaction on the field of honor. </b></p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre4">[ <i class="calibre3">Laughter. </i></b><b class="calibre4">]</b></p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre4">Secretary Ignatov: Silence in the gallery. </b></p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre4">Vyshinsky: What is your current address? </b></p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre4">Rostov: Suite 317 at the Hotel Metropol, Moscow. </b></p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre4">Vyshinsky: How long have you lived there? </b></p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre4">Rostov: I have been in residence since the fifth of September 1918. Just under four</b> <b class="calibre4">years. </b></p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre4">Vyshinsky: And your occupation? </b></p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre4">Rostov: It is not the business of gentlemen to have occupations. </b></p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre4">Vyshinsky: Very well then. How do you spend your time? </b></p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre4">Rostov: Dining, discussing. Reading, reflecting. The usual rigmarole. </b></p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre4">Vyshinsky: And you write poetry? </b></p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre4">Rostov: I have been known to fence with a quill. </b></p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre4">Vyshinsky: [ <i class="calibre3">Holding up a pamphlet</i></b><b class="calibre4">] Are you the author of this long poem of 1913:</b></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3"><b class="calibre4">Where Is It Now? </b></i></p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre4">Rostov: It has been attributed to me. </b></p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre4">Vyshinsky: Why did you write the poem? </b></p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre4">Rostov: It demanded to be written. I simply happened to be sitting at the particular</b> <b class="calibre4">desk on the particular morning when it chose to make its demands. </b></p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre4">Vyshinsky: And where was that exactly? </b></p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre4">Rostov: In the south parlor at Idlehour <i class="calibre3">. </i></b></p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre4">Vyshinsky: Idlehour? </b></p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre4">Rostov: The Rostov estate in Nizhny Novgorod. </b></p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre4">Vyshinsky: Ah, yes. Of course. How apt. But let us return our attention to your</b> <b class="calibre4">poem. Coming as it did—in the more subdued years after the failed revolt of 1905—</b></p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre4">many considered it a call to action. Would you agree with that assessment? </b></p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre4">Rostov: All poetry is a call to action. </b></p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre4">Vyshinsky: [ <i class="calibre3">Checking notes</i></b><b class="calibre4">] And it was in the spring of the following year that you</b> <b class="calibre4">left Russia for Paris . . . ? </b></p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre4">Rostov: I seem to remember blossoms on the apple trees. So, yes, in all likelihood</b> <b class="calibre4">it was spring. </b></p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre4">Vyshinsky: May 16 to be precise. Now, we understand the reasons for your self-imposed exile; and we even have some sympathy with the actions that prompted your</b> <b class="calibre4">flight. What concerns us here is your return in 1918. One wonders if you came back</b> <b class="calibre4">with the intention of taking up arms and, if so, whether for or against the</b> <b class="calibre4">Revolution. </b></p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p12"></a><b class="calibre4">Rostov: By that point, I’m afraid that my days of taking up arms were behind me. </b></p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre4">Vyshinsky: Why then did you come back? </b></p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre4">Rostov: I missed the climate. </b></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3"><b class="calibre4">[Laughter.]</b></i></p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre4">Vyshinsky: Count Rostov, you do not seem to appreciate the gravity of your position. </b></p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre4">Nor do you show the respect that is due the men convened before you. </b></p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre4">Rostov: The Tsarina had the same complaints about me in her day. </b></p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre4">Ignatov: Prosecutor Vyshinsky. If I may . . . </b></p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre4">Vyshinsky: Secretary Ignatov. </b></p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre4">Ignatov: I have no doubt, Count Rostov, that many in the gallery are surprised to</b> <b class="calibre4">find you so charming; but I, for one, am not surprised in the least. History has</b> <b class="calibre4">shown charm to be the final ambition of the leisure class. What I do find</b> <b class="calibre4">surprising is that the author of the poem in question could have become a man so</b> <b class="calibre4">obviously without purpose. </b></p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre4">Rostov: I have lived under the impression that a man’s purpose is known only to God. </b></p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre4">Ignatov: Indeed. How convenient that must have been for you. </b></p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre4">[The Committee recesses for twelve minutes.]</b></p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre4">Ignatov: Alexander Ilyich Rostov, taking into full account your own testimony, we</b> <b class="calibre4">can only assume that the clear-eyed spirit who wrote the poem  <i class="calibre3">Where Is It Now? </i></b><b class="calibre4"> has</b> <b class="calibre4">succumbed irrevocably to the corruptions of his class—and now poses a threat to</b> <b class="calibre4">the very ideals he once espoused. On that basis, our inclination would be to have</b> <b class="calibre4">you taken from this chamber and put against the wall. But there are those within</b> <b class="calibre4">the senior ranks of the Party who count you among the heroes of the</b> <b class="calibre4">prerevolutionary cause. Thus, it is the opinion of this committee that you should</b> <b class="calibre4">be returned to that hotel of which you are so fond. But make no mistake: should</b> <b class="calibre4">you ever set foot outside of the Metropol again, you will be shot. Next matter. </b></p>

<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre4">BOOK ONE</b></p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p14"></a><b class="calibre4">1922</b></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3"><b class="calibre4">An Ambassador</b></i></p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre4">A</b>t half past six on the twenty-first of June 1922, when Count Alexander Ilyich Rostov was escorted through the gates of the Kremlin onto Red Square, it was glorious and cool. Drawing his shoulders back without breaking stride, the Count inhaled the air like one fresh from a swim. The sky was the very blue that the cupolas of St. Basil’s had been painted for. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Their pinks, greens, and golds shimmered as if it were the sole purpose of a religion to cheer its Divinity. Even the Bolshevik girls conversing before the windows of the State Department Store seemed dressed to celebrate the last days of spring. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Hello, my good man,” the Count called to Fyodor, at the edge of the square. “I see the blackberries have come in early this year!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Giving the startled fruit seller no time to reply, the Count walked briskly on, his waxed moustaches spread like the wings of a gull. Passing through Resurrection Gate, he turned his back on the lilacs of the Alexander Gardens and proceeded toward Theatre Square, where the Hotel Metropol stood in all its glory. When he reached the threshold, the Count gave a wink to Pavel, the afternoon doorman, and turned with a hand outstretched to the two soldiers trailing behind him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Thank you, gentlemen, for delivering me safely. I shall no longer be in need of your assistance.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Though strapping lads, both of the soldiers had to look up from under their caps to return the Count’s gaze—for like ten generations of Rostov men, the Count stood an easy six foot three. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“On you go,” said the more thuggish of the two, his hand on the butt of his rifle. “We’re to see you to your rooms.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p15"></a><img class="calibre2" src="index-15_1.jpg"/></p>
<p class="calibre1">In the lobby, the Count gave a wide wave with which to simultaneously greet the unflappable Arkady (who was manning the front desk) and sweet Valentina (who was dusting a statuette). Though the Count had greeted them in this manner a hundred times before, both responded with a wide-eyed stare. It was the sort of reception one might have expected when arriving for a dinner party having forgotten to don one’s pants. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Passing the young girl with the penchant for yellow who was reading a magazine in her favorite lobby chair, the Count came to an abrupt stop before the potted palms in order to address his escort. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The lift or the stairs, gentlemen?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The soldiers looked from one another to the Count and back again, apparently unable to make up their minds. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The stairs,” he determined on their behalf, then vaulted the steps two at a time, as had been his habit since the academy. </p>
<p class="calibre1">On the third floor, the Count walked down the red-carpeted hallway toward his suite—an interconnected bedroom, bath, dining room, and grand salon with eight-foot windows overlooking the lindens of Theatre Square. </p>
<p class="calibre1">And there the rudeness of the day awaited. For before the flung-open doors of his rooms stood a captain of the guards with Pasha and Petya, the hotel’s bellhops. The two young men met the Count’s gaze with looks of embarrassment, having clearly been conscripted into some duty they found distasteful. The Count addressed the officer. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What is the meaning of this, Captain?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The captain, who seemed mildly surprised by the question, had the good training to maintain the evenness of his affect. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I am here to show you to your quarters.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“These  <i class="calibre3">are</i> my quarters.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Betraying the slightest suggestion of a smile, the captain replied, “No longer, I’m afraid.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Leaving Pasha and Petya behind, the captain led the Count and his escort to a utility stair hidden behind an inconspicuous door in the core of the hotel. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The ill-lit ascent turned a sharp corner every five steps in the manner of a belfry. Up they wound three flights to where a door opened on a narrow</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p16"></a>corridor servicing a bathroom and six bedrooms reminiscent of monastic cells. This attic was originally built to house the butlers and ladies’ maids of the Metropol’s guests; but when the practice of traveling with servants fell out of fashion, the unused rooms had been claimed by the caprices of casual urgency—thenceforth warehousing scraps of lumber, broken furniture, and other assorted debris. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Earlier that day, the room closest to the stairwell had been cleared of all but a cast-iron bed, a three-legged bureau, and a decade of dust. In the corner near the door was a small closet, rather like a telephone box, that had been dropped in the room as an afterthought. Reflecting the pitch of the roof, the ceiling sloped at a gradual incline as it moved away from the door, such that at the room’s outer wall the only place where the Count could stand to his full height was where a dormer accommodated a window the size of a chessboard. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As the two guards looked on smugly from the hall, the good captain explained that he had summoned the bellhops to help the Count move what few belongings his new quarters would accommodate. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“And the rest?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Becomes the property of the People.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">So this is their game, thought the Count. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Very well.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Back down the belfry he skipped as the guards hurried behind him, their rifles clacking against the wall. On the third floor, he marched along the hallway and into his suite where the two bellhops looked up with woeful expressions. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It’s all right, fellows,” the Count assured and then began pointing:</p>
<p class="calibre1">“This. That. Those.  <i class="calibre3">All</i> the books.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Among the furnishings destined for his new quarters, the Count chose two high-back chairs, his grandmother’s oriental coffee table, and a favorite set of her porcelain plates. He chose the two table lamps fashioned from ebony elephants and the portrait of his sister, Helena, which Serov had painted during a brief stay at Idlehour in 1908. He did not forget the leather case that had been fashioned especially for him by Asprey in London and which his good friend Mishka had so appropriately christened the Ambassador. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p17"></a>Someone had shown the courtesy of having one of the Count’s traveling trunks brought to his bedroom. So, as the bellhops carried the aforementioned upward, the Count filled the trunk with clothes and personal effects. Noting that the guards were eyeing the two bottles of brandy on the console, the Count tossed them in as well. And once the trunk had been carried upstairs, he finally pointed to the desk. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The two bellhops, their bright blue uniforms already smudged from their efforts, took hold of it by the corners. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But it weighs a ton,” said one to the other. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“A king fortifies himself with a castle,” observed the Count, “a gentleman with a desk.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">As the bellhops lugged it into the hall, the Rostovs’ grandfather clock, which was fated to be left behind, tolled a doleful eight. The captain had long since returned to his post and the guards, having swapped their belligerence for boredom, now leaned against the wall and let the ashes from their cigarettes fall on the parquet floor while into the grand salon poured the undiminished light of the Moscow summer solstice. </p>

<p class="calibre1">The Count smiled to remember his own youthful preference for arriving <i class="calibre3">entr’acte</i>. Having insisted at the English Club that he could only stay for one more drink, he stayed for three. Then leaping into the waiting carriage, he’d flash across the city, vault the fabled steps, and like this young fellow slip through the golden doors. As the ballerinas danced gracefully across the stage, the Count would be whispering his  <i class="calibre3">excusez-moi</i>’s, making his way to his usual seat in the twentieth row with its privileged view of the ladies in the loges. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Arriving late, thought the Count with a sigh. What a delicacy of youth. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p18"></a>Then he turned on his heels and began to walk his rooms. First, he admired the salon’s grand dimensions and its two chandeliers. He admired the painted panels of the little dining room and the elaborate brass mechanics that allowed one to secure the double doors of the bedroom. In short, he reviewed the interior much as would a potential buyer who was seeing the rooms for the very first time. Once in the bedroom, the Count paused before the marble-topped table on which lay an assortment of curios. From among them, he picked up a pair of scissors that had been prized by his sister. Fashioned in the shape of an egret with the long silver blades representing the bird’s beak and the small golden screw at the pivot representing its eye, the scissors were so delicate he could barely fit his thumb and finger through the rings. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Looking from one end of the apartment to the other, the Count took a quick inventory of all that would be left behind. What personal possessions, furnishings, and  <i class="calibre3">objets d’art</i> he had brought to this suite four years before were already the product of a great winnowing. For when word had reached the Count of the Tsar’s execution, he had set out from Paris at once. Over twenty days, he had made his way across six nations and skirted eight battalions fighting under five different flags, finally arriving at Idlehour on the seventh of August 1918, with nothing but a rucksack on his back. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Though he found the countryside on the verge of upheaval and the household in a state of distress, his grandmother, the Countess, was characteristically composed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Sasha,” she said without rising from her chair, “how good of you to come. You must be famished. Join me for tea.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">When he explained the necessity of her leaving the country and described the arrangements he had made for her passage, the Countess understood that there was no alternative. She understood that although every servant in her employ was ready to accompany her, she must travel with two. She also understood why her grandson and only heir, whom she had raised from the age of ten, would not be coming with her. </p>
<p class="calibre1">When the Count was just seven, he was defeated so soundly by a neighboring boy in a game of draughts that, apparently, a tear was shed, a curse was uttered, and the game pieces were scattered across the floor. This lack of sportsmanship led to a stiff reprimand from the Count’s father and a trip to bed without supper. But as the young Count was gripping his blanket</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p19"></a>in misery, he was visited by his grandmother. Taking a seat at the foot of the bed, the Countess expressed a measure of sympathy: “There is nothing pleasant to be said about losing,” she began, “and the Obolensky boy is a pill. But, Sasha, my dear, why on earth would you give him the satisfaction?” It was in this spirit that he and his grandmother parted without tears on the docks in Peterhof. Then the Count returned to the family estate in order to administer its shuttering. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In quick succession came the sweeping of chimneys, the clearing of pantries, and the shrouding of furniture. It was just as if the family were returning to St. Petersburg for the season, except that the dogs were released from their kennels, the horses from their stables, and the servants from their duties. Then, having filled a single wagon with some of the finest of the Rostovs’ furniture, the Count bolted the doors and set out for Moscow. </p>
<p class="calibre1">’Tis a funny thing, reflected the Count as he stood ready to abandon his suite. From the earliest age, we must learn to say good-bye to friends and family. We see our parents and siblings off at the station; we visit cousins, attend schools, join the regiment; we marry, or travel abroad. It is part of the human experience that we are constantly gripping a good fellow by the shoulders and wishing him well, taking comfort from the notion that we will hear word of him soon enough. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But experience is less likely to teach us how to bid our dearest possessions  <i class="calibre3">adieu</i>. And if it were to? We wouldn’t welcome the education. </p>
<p class="calibre1">For eventually, we come to hold our dearest possessions more closely than we hold our friends. We carry them from place to place, often at considerable expense and inconvenience; we dust and polish their surfaces and reprimand children for playing too roughly in their vicinity—all the while, allowing memories to invest them with greater and greater importance. This armoire, we are prone to recall, is the very one in which we hid as a boy; and it was these silver candelabra that lined our table on Christmas Eve; and it was with this handkerchief that she once dried her tears, et cetera, et cetera. Until we imagine that these carefully preserved possessions might give us genuine solace in the face of a lost companion. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But, of course, a thing is just a thing. </p>
<p class="calibre1">And so, slipping his sister’s scissors into his pocket, the Count looked once more at what heirlooms remained and then expunged them from his heartache forever. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p20"></a><img class="calibre2" src="index-20_1.jpg"/></p>
<p class="calibre1">One hour later, as the Count bounced twice on his new mattress to identify the key of the bedsprings (G-sharp), he surveyed the furniture that had been stacked around him and reminded himself how, as a youth, he had longed for trips to France by steamship and Moscow by the overnight train. </p>
<p class="calibre1">And why had he longed for those particular journeys? </p>
<p class="calibre1">Because their berths had been so small! </p>

<p class="calibre1">Well. At long last, here he was. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Besides, with half the rooms on the second floor temporarily commandeered by the Bolsheviks for the tireless typing of directives, at least on the sixth floor a man could hear himself think. <a href="index_split_006.html#p454">*</a></p>
<p class="calibre1">The Count stood and banged his head on the slope of the ceiling. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Just so,” he replied. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Easing one of the high-back chairs aside and moving the elephant lamps to the bed, the Count opened his trunk. First, he took out the photograph of the Delegation and placed it on the desk where it belonged. Then he took out the two bottles of brandy and his father’s twice-tolling clock. But when he took out his grandmother’s opera glasses and placed them on the desk, a fluttering drew his attention toward the dormer. Though the window was only the size of a dinner invitation, the Count could see that a pigeon had landed outside on the copper stripping of the ledge. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Why, hello,” said the Count. “How kind of you to stop by.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The pigeon looked back with a decidedly proprietary air. Then it scuffed the flashing with its claws and thrust its beak at the window several times in quick succession. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Ah, yes,” conceded the Count. “There is something in what you say.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p21"></a>He was about to explain to his new neighbor the cause of his unexpected arrival, when from the hallway came the delicate clearing of a throat. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Without turning, the Count could tell that this was Andrey, the maître d’ of the Boyarsky, for it was his trademark interruption. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nodding once to the pigeon to indicate that they would resume their discussion anon, the Count rebuttoned his jacket and turned to find that it was not Andrey alone who had paid a visit: three members of the hotel’s staff were crowded in the doorway. </p>
<p class="calibre1">There was Andrey with his perfect poise and long judicious hands; Vasily, the hotel’s inimitable concierge; and Marina, the shy delight with the wandering eye who had recently been promoted from chambermaid to seamstress. The three of them exhibited the same bewildered gaze that the Count had noticed on the faces of Arkady and Valentina a few hours before, and finally it struck him: When he had been carted off that morning, they had all assumed that he would never return. He had emerged from behind the walls of the Kremlin like an aviator from the wreckage of a crash. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“My dear friends,” said the Count, “no doubt you are curious as to the day’s events. As you may know, I was invited to the Kremlin for a  <i class="calibre3">tête-à-</i></p>

<p class="calibre1">In response to the cheers, the Count shook hands with his guests one by one, expressing to each his appreciation for their fellowship and his heartfelt thanks. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Come in, come in,” he said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Together, the three staff members squeezed their way between the teetering towers of furniture. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“If you would be so kind,” said the Count, handing Andrey one of the bottles of brandy. Then he kneeled before the Ambassador, threw the clasps, and opened it like a giant book. Carefully secured inside were fifty-two glasses—or more precisely, twenty-six  <i class="calibre3">pairs </i> of glasses—each shaped to its purpose, from the grand embrace of the Burgundy glass down to those charming little vessels designed for the brightly colored liqueurs of southern Europe. In the spirit of the hour, the Count picked four glasses at random and passed them around as Andrey, having plucked the cork from the bottle, performed the honors. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p22"></a><img class="calibre2" src="index-22_1.jpg"/></p>
<p class="calibre1">Once his guests had their brandy in hand, the Count raised his own on high. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“To the Metropol,” he said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“To the Metropol!” they replied. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The Count was something of a natural-born host and in the hour that ensued, as he topped a glass here and sparked a conversation there, he had an instinctive awareness of all the temperaments in the room. Despite the formality appropriate to his position, tonight Andrey exhibited a ready smile and an occasional wink. Vasily, who spoke with such pointed accuracy when providing directions to the city’s sights, suddenly had the lilt of one who may or may not remember tomorrow what he had said today. </p>
<p class="calibre1">And at every jest, the shy Marina allowed herself to giggle without placing a hand in front of her lips. </p>
<p class="calibre1">On this of all nights, the Count deeply appreciated their good cheer; but he was not so vain as to imagine it was founded solely on news of his narrow escape. For as he knew better than most, it was in September of 1905 that the members of the Delegation had signed the Treaty of Portsmouth to end the Russo-Japanese War. In the seventeen years since the making of that peace—hardly a generation—Russia had suffered a world war, a civil war, two famines, and the so-called Red Terror. In short, it had been through an era of upheaval that had spared none. Whether one’s leanings were left or right, Red or White, whether one’s personal circumstances had changed for the better or changed for the worse, surely at long last it was time to drink to the health of the nation. </p>
<p class="calibre1">At ten o’clock, the Count walked his guests to the belfry and bid them goodnight with the same sense of ceremony that he would have exhibited at the door of his family’s residence in St. Petersburg. Returning to his quarters, he opened the window (though it was only the size of a postage stamp), poured the last of the brandy, and took a seat at the desk. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Built in the Paris of Louis XVI with the gilded accents and leather top of the era, the desk had been left to the Count by his godfather, Grand Duke Demidov. A man of great white sideburns, pale blue eyes, and golden</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p23"></a>epaulettes, the Grand Duke spoke four languages and read six <i class="calibre3">. </i> Never to wed, he represented his country at Portsmouth, managed three estates, and generally prized industry over nonsense. But before all of that, he had served alongside the Count’s father as a devil-may-care cadet in the cavalry. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Thus had the Grand Duke become the Count’s watchful guardian. And when the Count’s parents succumbed to cholera within hours of each other in 1900, it was the Grand Duke who took the young Count aside and explained that he must be strong for his sister’s sake; that adversity presents itself in many forms; and that if a man does not master his circumstances then he is bound to be mastered by them. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The Count ran his hand across the desk’s dimpled surface. </p>
<p class="calibre1">How many of the Grand Duke’s words did those faint indentations reflect? Here over forty years had been written concise instructions to caretakers; persuasive arguments to statesmen; exquisite counsel to friends. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In other words, it was a desk to be reckoned with. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Emptying his glass, the Count pushed his chair back and sat on the floor. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He ran his hand behind the desk’s right front leg until he found the catch. </p>
<p class="calibre1">When he pressed it, a seamless door opened to reveal a velvet-lined hollow that, like the hollows in the other three legs, was stacked with pieces of gold. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p24"></a> <i class="calibre3"><b class="calibre4">An Anglican Ashore</b></i></p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre4">W</b>hen he began to stir at half past nine, in the shapeless moments before the return to consciousness Count Alexander Ilyich Rostov savored the taste of the day to come. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Within the hour, he would be in the warm spring air striding along Tverskaya Street, his moustaches at full sail. En route, he would purchase the <i class="calibre3"> Herald</i> from the stand on Gazetny Lane, he would pass Filippov’s (pausing only briefly to eye the pastries in the window) and then continue on to meet with his bankers. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But coming to a halt at the curb (in order to the let the traffic pass), the Count would note that his lunch at the Jockey Club was scheduled for two o’clock—and that while his bankers were expecting him at half past ten, they were for all intents and purposes in the employ of their depositors, and thus could presumably be kept waiting. . . . With these thoughts in mind, he would double back and, taking his top hat from his head, open Filippov’s door. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In an instant, his senses would be rewarded by the indisputable evidence of the baker’s mastery. Drifting in the air would be the gentle aroma of freshly baked pretzels, sweet rolls, and loaves of bread so unparalleled they were delivered daily to the Hermitage by train—while arranged in perfect rows behind the glass of the front case would be cakes topped in frostings as varied in color as the tulips of Amsterdam. Approaching the counter, the Count would ask the young lady with the light blue apron for a mille-feuille (how aptly named) and watch with admiration as she used a teaspoon to gently nudge the delicacy from a silver spade onto a porcelain plate. </p>
<p class="calibre1">His refreshment in hand, the Count would take a seat as close as possible to the little table in the corner where young ladies of fashion met each morning to review the previous evening’s intrigues. Mindful of their surroundings, the three damsels would initially speak in the hushed voices of gentility; but swept away by the currents of their own emotions, their</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p25"></a>voices would inevitably rise, such that by 11:15, even the most discreet enjoyer of a pastry would have no choice but to eavesdrop on the thousand-layered complications of their hearts. </p>
<p class="calibre1">By 11:45, having cleaned his plate and brushed the crumbs from his moustaches, having waved a thanks to the girl behind the counter and tipped his hat to the three young ladies with whom he had briefly chatted, he would step back onto Tverskaya Street and pause to consider:  <i class="calibre3">What</i> <i class="calibre3">next? </i> Perhaps he would stop by Galerie Bertrand to see the latest canvases from Paris, or slip into the hall of the Conservatory where some youthful quartet was trying to master a bit of Beethoven; perhaps he would simply circle back to the Alexander Gardens, where he could find a bench and admire the lilacs as a pigeon cooed and shuffled its feet on the copper flashing of the sill. </p>
<p class="calibre1">On the copper flashing of the sill . . . </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Ah, yes,” acknowledged the Count. “I suppose there’s to be none of that.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">If the Count were to close his eyes and roll to the wall, was it possible that he could return to his bench just in time to remark,  <i class="calibre3">What a lovely</i> <i class="calibre3">coincidence</i>, when the three young ladies from Filippov’s happened by? </p>
<p class="calibre1">Without a doubt. But imagining what might happen if one’s circumstances were different was the only sure route to madness. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Sitting upright, the Count put the soles of his feet squarely on the uncarpeted floor and gave the compass points of his moustaches a twist. </p>
<p class="calibre1">On the Grand Duke’s desk stood a champagne flute and a brandy snifter. </p>
<p class="calibre1">With the lean uprightness of the former looking down upon the squat rotundity of the latter, one could not help but think of Don Quixote and Sancho Panza on the plains of the Sierra Morena. Or of Robin Hood and Friar Tuck in the shadows of Sherwood Forest. Or of Prince Hal and Falstaff before the gates of—</p>
<p class="calibre1">But there was a knock at the door. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The Count stood and hit his head against the ceiling. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“One moment,” he called, rubbing his crown and rummaging through his trunk for a robe. Once suitably attired, he opened the door to find an industrious young fellow standing in the hall with the Count’s daily breakfast—a pot of coffee, two biscuits, and a piece of fruit (today a plum). </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well done, Yuri! Come in, come in. Set it there, set it there.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p26"></a>As Yuri arranged the breakfast on top of the trunk, the Count sat at the Grand Duke’s desk and penned a quick note to one Konstantin Konstantinovich of Durnovksi Street. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Would you be so kind as to have this delivered, my boy?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Never one to shirk, Yuri happily took the note, promised to relay it by hand, and accepted a tip with a bow. Then at the threshold he paused. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Shall I . . . leave the door ajar?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">It was a reasonable question. For the room was rather stuffy, and on the sixth floor there was hardly much risk of one’s privacy being compromised. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Please do.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">As Yuri’s steps sounded down the belfry, the Count placed his napkin in his lap, poured a cup of coffee, and graced it with a few drops of cream. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Taking his first sip, he noted with satisfaction that young Yuri must have sprinted up the extra three flights of stairs because the coffee was not one degree colder than usual. </p>

<p class="calibre1">“Yes,” said the Count after completing his own survey. “I see what you mean.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The crowded confusion of furniture gave the Count’s little domain the look of a consignment shop in the Arbat. In a room this size, he could have made do with a single high-back chair, a single bedside table, and a single lamp. He could have made do without his grandmother’s Limoges altogether. </p>
<p class="calibre1">And the books?  <i class="calibre3">All of them! </i> he had said with such bravado. But in the light of day, he had to admit that this instruction had been prompted less by</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p27"></a>good sense than by a rather childish impulse to impress the bellhops and put the guards in their place. For the books were not even to the Count’s taste. </p>
<p class="calibre1">His personal library of majestic narratives by the likes of Balzac, Dickens, and Tolstoy had been left behind in Paris. The books the bellhops had lugged to the attic had been his father’s and, devoted as they were to studies of rational philosophy and the science of modern agriculture, each promised heft and threatened impenetrability. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Without a doubt, one more winnowing was called for. </p>
<p class="calibre1">So, having broken his fast, bathed, and dressed, the Count went about the business. First, he tried the door of the adjacent room. It must have been blocked on the inside by something quite heavy, for under the force of the Count’s shoulder it barely budged. In the next three rooms, the Count found flotsam and jetsam from floor to ceiling. But in the last room, amidst tiles of slate and strips of flashing, an ample space had been cleared around a dented old samovar where some roofers had once taken their tea. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Back in his room, the Count hung a few jackets in his closet. He unpacked some trousers and shirts into the back right corner of his bureau (to ensure that the three-legged beast wouldn’t topple). Down the hall he dragged his trunk, half of his furniture, and all of his father’s books but one. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Thus, within an hour he had reduced his room to its essentials: a desk and chair, a bed and bedside table, a high-back chair for guests, and a ten-foot passage just wide enough for a gentleman to circumambulate in reflection. </p>
<p class="calibre1">With satisfaction the Count looked toward the cat (who was busy licking the cream from his paws in the comfort of the high-back chair). “What say you now, you old pirate?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Then he sat at his desk and picked up the one volume that he had retained. It must have been a decade since the Count had first promised himself to read this work of universal acclaim that his father had held so dear. And yet, every time he had pointed his finger at his calendar and declared:  <i class="calibre3">This is the month in which I shall devote myself to the</i> Essays  <i class="calibre3">of</i> <i class="calibre3">Michel de Montaigne! </i> some devilish aspect of life had poked its head in the door. From an unexpected corner had come an expression of romantic interest, which could not in good conscience be ignored. Or his banker had called. Or the circus had come to town. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Life will entice, after all. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p28"></a>But here, at last, circumstance had conspired not to distract the Count, but to present him with the time and solitude necessary to give the book its due. So, with the volume firmly in hand, he put one foot on the corner of the bureau, pushed back until his chair was balanced on its two rear legs, and began to read:</p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3"><b class="calibre4">By Diverse Means We Arrive at the Same End</b></i></p>
<p class="calibre1">The commonest way of softening the hearts of those we have offended, when, vengeance in hand, they hold us at their mercy, is by submission to move them to commiseration and pity. However, audacity and steadfastness—entirely contrary means—have sometimes served to produce the same</p>
<p class="calibre1">effect. . . . </p>
<p class="calibre1">It was at Idlehour that the Count had first formed the habit of reading in a tilted chair. </p>
<p class="calibre1">On those glorious spring days when the orchards were in bloom and the foxtails bobbed above the grass, he and Helena would seek out a pleasant corner to while away the hours. One day it might be under the pergola on the upper patio and the next beside the great elm that overlooked the bend in the river. As Helena embroidered, the Count would tilt back his chair—</p>
<p class="calibre1">balancing himself by resting a foot lightly on the lip of the fountain or the trunk of the tree—in order to read aloud from her favorite works of Pushkin. And hour upon hour, stanza upon stanza, her little needle would go round and round. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Where are all those stitches headed?” he would occasionally demand at the end of a page. “Surely, by now, every pillow in the household has been graced by a butterfly and every handkerchief by a monogram.” And when he accused her of unwinding her stitches at night like Penelope just so that he would have to read her another volume of verse, she would smile inscrutably. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Looking up from the pages of Montaigne, the Count rested his gaze on Helena’s portrait, which was leaning against the wall. Painted at Idlehour in the month of August, it depicted his sister at the dining room table before a</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p29"></a>plate of peaches. How well Serov had captured her likeness—with her hair as black as a raven’s, her cheeks lightly flushed, her expression tender and forgiving. Perhaps there had been something in those stitches, thought the Count, some gentle wisdom that she was mastering through the completion of every little loop. Yes, with such kindheartedness at the age of fourteen, one could only imagine the grace she might have exhibited at the age of twenty-five. . . . </p>
<p class="calibre1">The Count was roused from this reverie by a delicate tapping. Closing his father’s book, he looked back to find a sixty-year-old Greek in the doorway. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Konstantin Konstantinovich!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Letting the front legs of his chair land on the floor with a thump, the Count crossed to the threshold and took his visitor’s hand. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I am so glad you could come. We have only met once or twice, so you may not remember, but I am Alexander Rostov.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The old Greek gave a bow to show that no reminder was necessary. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Come in, come in. Have a seat.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Waving Montaigne’s masterpiece at the one-eyed cat (who leapt to the floor with a hiss), the Count offered his guest the high-back chair and took the desk chair for himself. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In the moment that ensued, the old Greek returned the Count’s gaze with an expression of moderate curiosity—which was to be expected, perhaps, given that they had never met on a matter of business. After all, the Count was not accustomed to losing at cards. So the Count took it upon himself to begin. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“As you can see, Konstantin, my circumstances have changed.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The Count’s guest allowed himself an expression of surprise. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No, it is true,” said the Count. “They have changed quite a bit.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Looking once about the room, the old Greek raised his hands to acknowledge the doleful impermanence of circumstances, </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Perhaps you are looking for access to some . . . capital?” he ventured. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In making this suggestion, the old Greek paused ever so briefly before the word  <i class="calibre3">capital</i>. And in the Count’s considered opinion, it was a perfect pause—one mastered over decades of delicate conversations. It was a pause with which he expressed an element of sympathy for his interlocutor</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p30"></a>without suggesting for even an instant that there had been a change in their relative stations. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No, no,” assured the Count with a shake of the head to emphasize that borrowing was not a habit of the Rostovs. “On the contrary, Konstantin, I have something that I think will be of interest to you.” Then, as if from thin air, the Count produced one of the coins from the Grand Duke’s desk, balancing it upright on the tip of a finger and thumb. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The old Greek studied the coin for a second and then, in a sign of appreciation, slowly exhaled. For while Konstantin Konstantinovich was a lender by trade, his  <i class="calibre3">art</i> was to see an item for a minute, to hold it for a moment, and to know its true worth. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“May I . . . ?” he asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“By all means.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He took the coin, turned it once, and handed it back with reverence. For not only was the piece pure in the metallurgical sense, the winking double eagle on the reverse confirmed to the experienced eye that it was one of the five thousand coins minted in commemoration of Catherine the Great’s coronation. Such a piece purchased from a gentleman in need could be sold at a reasonable profit to the most cautious of banking houses in the best of times. But in a period of upheaval? Even as the demand for common luxuries collapsed, the value of a treasure like this would be on the rise. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Excuse my curiosity, Your Excellency, but is that a . . . lonely piece?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Lonely? Oh, no,” replied the Count with a shake of the head. “It lives like a soldier in a barracks. Like a slave in a galley. Not a moment to itself, I’m afraid.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The old Greek exhaled again. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well then . . .” </p>
<p class="calibre1">And in a matter of minutes the two men had struck an arrangement without a hem or haw. What is more, the old Greek said it would be his pleasure to personally deliver three notes, which the Count penned on the spot. Then they shook hands like familiars and agreed to see each other three months hence. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But just as the old Greek was about to step through the door, he paused. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Your Excellency . . . May I ask a personal question?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“By all means.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He gestured almost shyly to the Grand Duke’s desk. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p31"></a><img class="calibre2" src="index-31_1.jpg"/></p>
<p class="calibre1">“Can we expect more verses from you?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The Count offered an appreciative smile. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I am sorry to say, Konstantin, that my days of poetry are behind me.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“If your days of poetry are behind you, Count Rostov, then it is we who are sorry.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Tucked discreetly into the northeast corner of the hotel’s second floor was the Boyarsky—the finest restaurant in Moscow, if not in all of Russia. With vaulted ceilings and dark red walls reminiscent of a boyar’s retreat, the Boyarsky boasted the city’s most elegant décor, its most sophisticated waitstaff, and its most subtle chef de cuisine. </p>
<p class="calibre1">So renowned was the experience of dining at the Boyarsky that on any given night one might have to elbow one’s way through a crowd of hopefuls just to catch the eye of Andrey, as he presided over the large black book in which the names of the fortunate were set down; and when beckoned ahead by the maître d’, one could expect to be stopped five times in four languages on the way to one’s table in the corner, where one would be served flawlessly by a waiter in a white dinner jacket. </p>
<p class="calibre1">That is, one could expect this until 1920 when, having already sealed the borders, the Bolsheviks decided to prohibit the use of rubles in fine restaurants—effectively closing them to 99 percent of the population. So tonight, as the Count began to eat his entrée, water glasses clinked against cutlery, couples whispered awkwardly, and even the best of waiters found himself staring at the ceiling. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But every period has its virtues, even a time of turmoil. . . . </p>
<p class="calibre1">When Emile Zhukovsky was lured to the Metropol as chef de cuisine in 1912, he was given command of a seasoned staff and a sizable kitchen. In addition, he had the most celebrated larder east of Vienna. On his spice shelves was a compendium of the world’s predilections and in his cooler a comprehensive survey of birds and beasts hanging from hooks by their feet. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As such, one might naturally leap to the conclusion that 1912 had been a perfect year in which to measure the chef’s talents. But in a period of abundance any half-wit with a spoon can please a palate. To truly test a</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p32"></a>chef’s ingenuity, one must instead look to a period of want. And what provides want better than war? </p>
<p class="calibre1">In the Revolution’s aftermath—with its economic declines, failed crops, and halted trade—refined ingredients became as scarce in Moscow as butterflies at sea. The Metropol’s larder was depleted bushel by bushel, pound by pound, dash by dash, and its chef was left to meet the expectations of his audience with cornmeal, cauliflower, and cabbage—that is to say, with whatever he could get his hands on. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Yes, some claimed Emile Zhukovsky was a curmudgeon and others called him abrupt. Some said he was a short man with a shorter temper. But none could dispute his genius. Just consider the dish the Count was finishing at that very moment: a saltimbocca fashioned from necessity. In place of a cutlet of veal, Emile had pounded flat a breast of chicken. In place of prosciutto de Parma, he had shaved a Ukrainian ham. And in place of sage, that delicate leaf that binds the flavors together? He had opted for an herb that was as soft and aromatic as sage, but more bitter to the taste. . . . It wasn’t basil or oregano, of that the Count was certain, but he had definitely encountered it somewhere before. . . . </p>
<p class="calibre1">“How is everything this evening, Your Excellency?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Ah, Andrey. As usual, everything is perfect.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“And the saltimbocca?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Inspired. But I do have one question: The herb that Emile has tucked under the ham—I know it isn’t sage. By any chance, is it nettle?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Nettle? I don’t believe so. But I will inquire.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Then with a bow, the maître d’ excused himself. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Without a doubt Emile Zhukovsky was a genius, reflected the Count, but the man who secured the Boyarsky’s reputation for excellence by ensuring that all within its walls ran smoothly was Andrey Duras. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Born in the south of France, Andrey was handsome, tall, and graying at the temples, but his most distinguishing feature was not his looks, his height, or his hair. It was his hands. Pale and well manicured, his fingers were half an inch longer than the fingers of most men his height. Had he been a pianist, Andrey could easily have straddled a twelfth. Had he been a puppeteer, he could have performed the sword fight between Macbeth and Macduff as all three witches looked on. But Andrey was neither a pianist nor a puppeteer—or at least not in the traditional sense. He was the captain</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p33"></a><img class="calibre2" src="index-33_1.jpg"/></p>
<p class="calibre1">of the Boyarsky, and one watched in wonder as his hands fulfilled their purpose at every turn. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Having just led a group of women to their table, for instance, Andrey seemed to pull back their chairs all at once. When one of the ladies produced a cigarette, he had a lighter in one hand and was guarding the flame with the other (as if a draft had ever been felt within the walls of the Boyarsky!). And when the woman holding the wine list asked for a recommendation, he didn’t point to the 1900 Bordeaux—at least not in the Teutonic sense. Rather, he slightly extended his index finger in a manner reminiscent of that gesture on the Sistine Chapel’s ceiling with which the Prime Mover transmitted the spark of life. Then, excusing himself with a bow, he crossed the room and went through the kitchen door. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But before a minute could pass, the door swung open again—and there was Emile. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Five foot five and two hundred pounds, the chef glanced quickly about the room then marched toward the Count with Andrey trailing behind. As he crossed the dining room, the chef knocked into a customer’s chair and nearly toppled a busboy with his tray. Coming to an abrupt stop at the Count’s table, he looked him up and down as one might measure an opponent before challenging him to a duel. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“<i class="calibre3">Bravo, monsieur</i>,” he said in a tone of indignation. “<i class="calibre3">Bravo! </i>” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Then he turned on his heels and disappeared back into his kitchen. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Andrey, a little breathless, bowed to express both apologies and congratulations. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Nettle it was, Your Excellency. Your palate remains unsurpassed.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Though the Count was not a man to gloat, he could not repress a smile of satisfaction. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Knowing that the Count had a sweet tooth, Andrey gestured toward the dessert cart. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“May I bring you a slice of plum tart with our compliments . . . ?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Thank you for the thought, Andrey. Normally, I would leap at the chance. But tonight, I am otherwise committed.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p34"></a>Having acknowledged that a man must master his circumstances or otherwise be mastered by them, the Count thought it worth considering how one was most likely to achieve this aim when one had been sentenced to a life of confinement. </p>
<p class="calibre1">For Edmond Dantès in the Château d’If, it was thoughts of revenge that kept him clear minded. Unjustly imprisoned, he sustained himself by plotting the systematic undoing of his personal agents of villainy. For Cervantes, enslaved by pirates in Algiers, it was the promise of pages as yet unwritten that spurred him on. While for Napoleon on Elba, strolling among chickens, fending off flies, and sidestepping puddles of mud, it was visions of a triumphal return to Paris that galvanized his will to persevere. </p>

<p class="calibre1">It was to this end that the Count had given the old Greek three notes to deliver. Within a matter of hours, the Count had been visited by two messengers: a young lad from Muir &amp; Mirrielees bearing fine linens and a suitable pillow; and another from Petrovsky Passage with four bars of the Count’s favorite soap. </p>
<p class="calibre1">And the third respondent? She must have arrived while the Count was at dinner. For waiting on his bed was a light blue box with a single mille-feuille. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p35"></a> <i class="calibre3"><b class="calibre4">An Appointment</b></i></p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre4">N</b>ever had the chime of twelve been so welcome. Not in Russia. Not in Europe. Not in all the world. Had Romeo been told by Juliet that she would appear at her window at noon, the young Veronan’s rapture at the appointed hour could not have matched the Count’s. Had Dr. Stahlbaum’s children—Fritz and Clara—been told on Christmas morning that the drawing-room doors would be opened at midday, their elation could not have rivaled the Count’s upon the sounding of the first toll. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Admittedly, the Count had felt a touch of concern when he’d first lifted the book from the desk the day before. For as a single volume, it had the density of a dictionary or Bible—those books that one expects to consult, or possibly peruse, but never  <i class="calibre3">read</i>. But it was the Count’s review of the Contents—a list of 107 essays on the likes of Constancy, Moderation, Solitude, and Sleep—that confirmed his initial suspicion that the book had been written with winter nights in mind. Without a doubt, it was a book for when the birds had flown south, the wood was stacked by the fireplace, and the fields were white with snow; that is, for when one had no desire to venture out and one’s friends had no desire to venture in. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nonetheless, with a resolute glance at the time, much as a seasoned sea captain when setting out on an extended journey will log the exact hour he sets sail from port, the Count plowed once again into the waves of the first meditation: “By Diverse Means We Arrive at the Same End.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">In this opening essay—in which examples were expertly drawn from the annals of history—the author provided a most convincing argument that when one is at another’s mercy one should plead for one’s life. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p36"></a>Or remain proud and unbent. </p>
<p class="calibre1">At any rate, having firmly established that either approach might be the right one, the author proceeded to his second meditation: “Of Sadness.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Here, Montaigne quoted an array of unimpeachable authorities from the Golden Age who confirmed conclusively that sadness is an emotion best shared. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Or kept to oneself. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It was somewhere in the middle of the third essay that the Count found himself glancing at the clock for the fourth or fifth time. Or was it the sixth? </p>
<p class="calibre1">While the exact number of glances could not be determined, the evidence did seem to suggest that the Count’s attention had been drawn to the clock more than once. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But then, what a chronometer it was! </p>
<p class="calibre1">Made to order for the Count’s father by the venerable firm of Breguet, the twice-tolling clock was a masterpiece in its own right. Its white enamel face had the circumference of a grapefruit and its lapis lazuli body sloped asymptotically from its top to its base, while its jeweled inner workings had been cut by craftsmen known the world over for an unwavering commitment to precision. And their reputation was certainly well founded. </p>
<p class="calibre1">For as he progressed through the third essay (in which Plato, Aristotle, and Cicero had been crowded onto the couch with the Emperor Maximilian), the Count could hear every tick. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ten twenty and fifty-six seconds, the clock said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ten twenty and fifty-seven. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Fifty-eight. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Fifty-nine. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Why, this clock accounted the seconds as flawlessly as Homer accounted his dactyls and Peter the sins of the sinners. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But where were we? </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ah, yes: Essay Three <i class="calibre3">. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">The Count shifted his chair a little leftward in order to put the clock out of view, then he searched for the passage he’d been reading. He was almost certain it was in the fifth paragraph on the fifteenth page. But as he delved back into that paragraph’s prose, the context seemed utterly unfamiliar; as did the paragraphs that immediately preceded it. In fact, he had to turn back</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p37"></a><img class="calibre2" src="index-37_1.jpg"/></p>
<p class="calibre1">three whole pages before he found a passage that he recalled well enough to resume his progress in good faith. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Is that how it is with you?” the Count demanded of Montaigne. “One step forward and two steps back?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Intent upon showing who was master of whom, the Count vowed that he would not look up from the book again until he had reached the twenty-fifth essay. Spurred by his own resolve, the Count made quick work of Essays Four, Five, and Six. And when he dispatched Seven and Eight with even more alacrity, the twenty-fifth essay seemed as close at hand as a pitcher of water on a dining room table. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But as the Count advanced through Essays Eleven, Twelve, and Thirteen, his goal seemed to recede into the distance. It was suddenly as if the book were not a dining room table at all, but a sort of Sahara. And having emptied his canteen, the Count would soon be crawling across its sentences with the peak of each hard-won page revealing but another page beyond. . . . </p>
<p class="calibre1">Well then, so be it. Onward crawled the Count. </p>
<p class="calibre1">On past the hour of eleven. </p>
<p class="calibre1">On past the sixteenth essay. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Until, suddenly, that long-strided watchman of the minutes caught up with his bowlegged brother at the top of the dial. As the two embraced, the springs within the clock’s casing loosened, the wheels spun, and the miniature hammer fell, setting off the first of those dulcet tones that signaled the arrival of noon. </p>

<p class="calibre1">For over two centuries (or so historians tell us), it was from the St. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Petersburg salons that our country’s culture advanced. From those great rooms overlooking the Fontanka Canal, new cuisines, fashions, and ideas</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p38"></a>all took their first tentative steps into Russian society. But if this was so, it was largely due to the hive of activity beneath the parlor floors. For there, just a few steps below street level, were the butlers, cooks, and footmen who together ensured that when the notions of Darwin or Manet were first bandied about, all went off without a hitch. </p>
<p class="calibre1">And so it was in the Metropol. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ever since its opening in 1905, the hotel’s suites and restaurants had been a gathering spot for the glamorous, influential, and erudite; but the effortless elegance on display would not have existed without the services of the lower floor:</p>
<p class="calibre1">Coming off the wide marble steps that descended from the lobby, one first passed the newsstand, which offered a gentleman a hundred headlines, albeit now just in Russian. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Next was the shop of Fatima Federova, the florist. A natural casualty of the times, Fatima’s shelves had been emptied and her windows papered over back in 1920, turning one of the hotel’s brightest spots into one of its most forlorn. But in its day, the shop had sold flowers by the acre. It had provided the towering arrangements for the lobby, the lilies for the rooms, the bouquets of roses that were tossed at the feet of the Bolshoi ballerinas, as well as the boutonnieres on the men who did the tossing. What’s more, Fatima was fluent in the floral codes that had governed polite society since the Age of Chivalry. Not only did she know the flower that should be sent as an apology, she knew which flower to send when one has been late; when one has spoken out of turn; and when, having taking notice of the young lady at the door, one has carelessly overtrumped one’s partner. In short, Fatima knew a flower’s fragrance, color, and purpose better than a bee. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Well, Fatima’s may have been shuttered, reflected the Count, but weren’t the flower shops of Paris shuttered under the “reign” of Robespierre, and didn’t that city now abound in blossoms? Just so, the time for flowers in the Metropol would surely come again. </p>
<p class="calibre1">At the very end of the hall, one finally came to Yaroslav’s barbershop. A land of optimism, precision, and political neutrality, it was the Switzerland of the hotel. If the Count had vowed to master his circumstances through practicalities, then here was a glimpse of the means: a religiously kept appointment for a weekly trim. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p39"></a><img class="calibre2" src="index-39_1.jpg"/></p>
<p class="calibre1">When the Count entered the shop, Yaroslav was attending to a silver-haired customer in a light gray suit while a heavyset fellow in a rumpled jacket bided his time on the bench by the wall. Greeting the Count with a smile, the barber directed him to the empty chair at his side. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As the Count climbed into the chair, he offered a friendly nod to the heavyset fellow, then leaned back and let his eyes settle on that marvel of Yaroslav’s shop: his cabinet. Were one to ask Larousse to define the word <i class="calibre3">cabinet</i>, the acclaimed lexicographer might reply:  <i class="calibre3">A piece of furniture often</i> <i class="calibre3">adorned with decorative detail in which items may be stowed away from</i> <i class="calibre3">sight</i>. A serviceable definition, no doubt—one that would encompass everything from a kitchen cupboard in the countryside to a Chippendale in Buckingham Palace. But Yaroslav’s cabinet would not fit so neatly into such a description, for having been made solely of nickel and glass it had been designed not to hide its contents, but to reveal them to the naked eye. </p>
<p class="calibre1">And rightfully so. For this cabinet could be proud of all it contained: French soaps wrapped in waxed papers; British lathers in ivory drums; Italian tonics in whimsically shaped vials. And hidden in the back? That little black bottle that Yaroslav referred to with a wink as the Fountain of Youth. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In the mirror’s reflection, the Count now let his gaze shift to where Yaroslav was working his magic on the silver-haired gentleman with two sets of scissors simultaneously. In Yaroslav’s hands, the scissors initially recalled the  <i class="calibre3">entrechat</i> of the  <i class="calibre3">danseur</i> in a ballet, his legs switching back and forth in midair. But as the barber progressed, his hands moved with increasing speed until they leapt and kicked like a Cossack doing the hopak! Upon the execution of the final snip, it would have been perfectly appropriate for a curtain to drop only to be raised again a moment later so that the audience could applaud as the barber took a bow. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Yaroslav swung the white cape off his customer and snapped it in the air; he clicked his heels when accepting payment for a job well done; and as the gentleman exited the shop (looking younger and more distinguished than when he’d arrived), the barber approached the Count with a fresh cape. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Your Excellency. How are you?” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p40"></a>“Splendid, Yaroslav. At my utmost.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“And what is on the docket for today?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Just a trim, my friend. Just a trim.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">As the scissors began their delicate snipping, it seemed to the Count that the heavyset customer on the bench had undergone something of a transformation. Although the Count had given his friendly nod just moments before, in the interim the fellow’s face seemed to have taken on a rosier hue. The Count was sure of it, in fact, because the color was spreading to his ears. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The Count tried to make eye contact again, intending to offer another friendly nod, but the fellow had fixed his gaze on Yaroslav’s back. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I was next,” he said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Yaroslav, who like most artists tended to lose himself in his craft, continued clipping away with efficiency and grace. So, the fellow was forced to repeat himself, if a little more emphatically. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“<i class="calibre3">I was next. </i>” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Drawn from his artistic spell by the sharper intonation, Yaroslav offered a courteous reply:</p>
<p class="calibre1">“I will be with you in just a moment, sir.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That is what you said when I arrived.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">This was said with such unmistakable hostility that Yaroslav paused in his clipping and turned to meet his customer’s glare with a startled expression. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Though the Count had been raised never to interrupt a conversation, he felt that the barber should not be put in the position of having to explain the situation on his behalf. So, he interceded:</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yaroslav meant no offense, my good man. It just so happens that I have a standing appointment at twelve o’clock on Tuesdays.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The fellow now turned his glare upon the Count. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“A standing appointment,” he repeated. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Then he rose so abruptly that he knocked his bench back into the wall. </p>
<p class="calibre1">At full height, he was no more than five foot six. His fists, which jutted from the cuffs of his jacket, were as red as his ears. When he advanced a step, Yaroslav backed against the edge of his counter. The fellow took another step toward the barber and wrested one of the scissors from his</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p41"></a>hand. Then, with the deftness of a much slighter man, he turned, took the Count by the collar, and severed the right wing of his moustaches with a single snip. Tightening his hold, he pulled the Count forward until they were nearly nose to nose. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You’ll have your appointment soon enough,” he said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Then shoving the Count back in the chair, he tossed the scissors on the floor and strolled from the shop. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Your Excellency,” exclaimed Yaroslav, aghast. “I have never seen the man in my life. I don’t even know if he resides in the hotel. But he is not welcome here again, I assure you of that.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The Count, who was standing now, was inclined to echo Yaroslav’s indignation and commend a punishment that fit the crime. But then, what did the Count know about his assailant? </p>
<p class="calibre1">When he had first seen him sitting on the bench in his rumpled jacket, the Count had summed him up in an instant as some hardworking sort who, having stumbled upon the barbershop, had decided to treat himself to a cut. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But for all the Count knew, this fellow could have been one of the new residents of the second floor. Having come of age in an ironworks, he could have joined a union in 1912, led a strike in 1916, captained a Red battalion in 1918, and now found himself in command of an entire industry. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“He was perfectly right,” the Count said to Yaroslav. “He had been waiting in good faith. You only wished to honor my appointment. It was for me to cede the chair and suggest that you attend to him first.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But what are we to do?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The Count turned to the mirror and surveyed himself. He surveyed himself, perhaps, for the first time in years. </p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="p42"></a>knowing that a gentleman’s presence was best announced by his bearing, his remarks, and his manners. Not by the cut of his coat. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Yes, thought the Count, the world does spin. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In fact, it spins on its axis even as it revolves around the sun. And the galaxy turns as well, a wheel within a greater wheel, producing a chime of an entirely different nature than that of a tiny hammer in a clock. And when that celestial chime sounds, perhaps a mirror will suddenly serve its truer purpose—revealing to a man not who he imagines himself to be, but who he has become. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The Count resumed his place in the chair. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“A clean shave,” he said to the barber. “A clean shave, my friend.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p43"></a> <i class="calibre3"><b class="calibre4">An Acquaintanceship</b></i></p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre4">T</b>here were two restaurants in the Hotel Metropol: the Boyarsky, that fabled retreat on the second floor that we have already visited, and the grand dining room off the lobby known officially as the Metropol, but referred to affectionately by the Count as the Piazza. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Admittedly, the Piazza could not challenge the elegance of the Boyarsky’s décor, the sophistication of its service, or the subtlety of its cuisine. But the Piazza did not aspire to elegance, service, or subtlety. With eighty tables scattered around a marble fountain and a menu offering everything from cabbage piroghi to cutlets of veal, the Piazza was meant to be an extension of the city—of its gardens, markets, and thoroughfares. It was a place where Russians cut from every cloth could come to linger over coffee, happen upon friends, stumble into arguments, or drift into dalliances</p>
<p class="calibre1">—and where the lone diner seated under the great glass ceiling could indulge himself in admiration, indignation, suspicion, and laughter without getting up from his chair. </p>
<p class="calibre1">And the waiters? Like those of a Parisian café, the Piazza’s waiters could best be complimented as “efficient.” Accustomed to navigating crowds, they could easily seat your party of eight at a table for four. Having noted your preferences over the sound of the orchestra, within minutes they would return with the various drinks balanced on a tray and dispense them round the table in rapid succession without misplacing a glass. If, with your menu in hand, you hesitated for even a second to place your order, they would lean over your shoulder and poke at a specialty of the house. And when the last morsel of dessert had been savored, they would whisk away your plate, present your check, and make your change in under a minute. In other words, the waiters of the Piazza knew their trade to the crumb, the spoon, and the kopek. </p>
<p class="calibre1">At least, that was how things were before the war. . . . </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p44"></a>Today, the dining room was nearly empty and the Count was being served by someone who appeared not only new to the Piazza, but new to the art of waiting. Tall and thin, with a narrow head and superior demeanor, he looked rather like a bishop that had been plucked from a chessboard. When the Count took his seat with a newspaper in hand—the international symbol of dining alone—the chap didn’t bother to clear the second setting; when the Count closed his menu and placed it beside his plate—the international symbol of readiness to order—the chap needed to be beckoned with a wave of the hand; and when the Count ordered the okroshka and filet of sole, the chap asked if he might like a glass of Sauterne. A perfect suggestion, no doubt, if only the Count had ordered foie gras! </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Perhaps a bottle of the Château de Baudelaire,” the Count corrected politely. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Of course,” the Bishop replied with an ecclesiastical smile. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Granted, a bottle of Baudelaire was something of an extravagance for a solitary lunch, but after spending another morning with the indefatigable Michel de Montaigne, the Count felt that his morale could use the boost. </p>
<p class="calibre1">For several days, in fact, he had been fending off a state of restlessness. On his regular descent to the lobby, he caught himself counting the steps. As he browsed the headlines in his favorite chair, he found he was lifting his hands to twirl the tips of moustaches that were no longer there. He found he was walking through the door of the Piazza at 12:01 for lunch. And at 1:35, when he climbed the 110 steps to his room, he was already calculating the minutes until he could come back downstairs for a drink. If he continued along this course, it would not take long for the ceiling to edge downward, the walls to edge inward, and the floor to edge upward, until the entire hotel had been collapsed into the size of a biscuit tin. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As the Count waited for his wine, he gazed around the restaurant, but his fellow diners offered no relief. Across the way was a table occupied by two stragglers from the diplomatic corps who picked at their food while they awaited an era of diplomacy. Over there in the corner was a spectacled denizen of the second floor with four enormous documents spread across his table, comparing them word for word. No one appeared particularly gay; and no one paid the Count any mind. That is, except for the young girl with the penchant for yellow who appeared to be spying on him from her table behind the fountain. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p45"></a>According to Vasily, this nine-year-old with straight blond hair was the daughter of a widowed Ukrainian bureaucrat. As usual, she was sitting with her governess. When she realized the Count was looking her way, she disappeared behind her menu. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Your soup,” said the Bishop. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Ah. Thank you, my good man. It looks delicious. But don’t forget the wine!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Of course.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Turning his attention to his okroshka, the Count could tell at a glance that it was a commendable execution—a bowl of soup that any Russian in the room might have been served by his grandmother. Closing his eyes in order to give the first spoonful its due consideration, the Count noted a suitably chilled temperature, a tad too much salt, a tad too little kvass, but a perfect expression of dill—that harbinger of summer which brings to mind the songs of crickets and the setting of one’s soul at ease. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But when the Count opened his eyes, he nearly dropped his spoon. For standing at the edge of his table was the young girl with the penchant for yellow—studying him with that unapologetic interest peculiar to children and dogs. Adding to the shock of her sudden appearance was the fact that her dress today was in the shade of a lemon. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Where did they go?” she asked, without a word of introduction. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I beg your pardon. Where did who go?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">She tilted her head to take a closer look at his face. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Why, your moustaches.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The Count had not much cause to interact with children, but he had been raised well enough to know that a child should not idly approach a stranger, should not interrupt him in the middle of a meal, and certainly should not ask him questions about his personal appearance. Was the minding of one’s own business no longer a subject taught in schools? </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Like swallows,” the Count answered, “they traveled elsewhere for the summer.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Then he fluttered a hand from the table into the air in order to both mimic the flight of the swallows and suggest how a child might follow suit. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She nodded to express her satisfaction with his response. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I too will be traveling elsewhere for part of the summer.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The Count inclined his head to indicate his congratulations. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p46"></a>“To the Black Sea,” she added. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Then she pulled back the empty chair and sat. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Would you like to join me?” he asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">By way of response, she wiggled back and forth to make herself comfortable then rested her elbows on the table. Around her neck hung a small pendant on a golden chain, some lucky charm or locket. The Count looked toward the young lady’s governess with the hopes of catching her attention, but she had obviously learned from experience to keep her nose in her book. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The girl gave another canine tilt to her head. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Is it true that you are a count?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“’Tis true.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Her eyes widened. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Have you ever known a princess?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I have known many princesses.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Her eyes widened further, then narrowed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Was it terribly hard to be a princess?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Terribly.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">At that moment, despite the fact that half of the okroshka remained in its bowl, the Bishop appeared with the Count’s filet of sole and swapped one for the other. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Thank you,” said the Count, his spoon still in hand. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Of course.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The Count opened his mouth to inquire as to the whereabouts of the Baudelaire, but the Bishop had already vanished. When the Count turned back to his guest, she was staring at his fish. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What is that?” she wanted to know. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“This? It is filet of sole.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Is it good?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Didn’t you have a lunch of your own?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I didn’t like it.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The Count transferred a taste of his fish to a side plate and passed it across the table. “With my compliments.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">She forked the whole thing in her mouth. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It’s yummy,” she said, which if not the most elegant expression was at least factually correct. Then she smiled a little sadly and let out a sigh as</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p47"></a>she directed her bright blue gaze upon the rest of his lunch. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Hmm,” said the Count. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Retrieving the side plate, he transferred half his sole along with an equal share of spinach and baby carrots, and returned it. She wiggled back and forth once more, presumably to settle in for the duration. Then, having carefully pushed the vegetables to the edge of the plate, she cut her fish into four equal portions, put the right upper quadrant in her mouth, and resumed her line of inquiry. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“How would a princess spend her day?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Like any young lady,” answered the Count. </p>
<p class="calibre1">With a nod of the head, the girl encouraged him to continue. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“In the morning, she would have lessons in French, history, music. After her lessons, she might visit with friends or walk in the park. And at lunch she would eat her vegetables.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“My father says that princesses personify the decadence of a vanquished era.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The Count was taken aback. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Perhaps a few,” he conceded. “But not all, I assure you.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">She waved her fork. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Don’t worry. Papa is wonderful and he knows everything there is to know about the workings of tractors. But he knows absolutely nothing about the workings of princesses.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The Count offered an expression of relief. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Have you ever been to a ball?” she continued after a moment of thought. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Certainly.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Did you dance?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I have been known to scuff the parquet.” The Count said this with the renowned glint in his eye—that little spark that had defused heated conversations and caught the eyes of beauties in every salon in St. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Petersburg. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Scuff the parquet?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Ahem,” said the Count. “Yes, I have danced at balls.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“And have you lived in a castle?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Castles are not as common in our country as they are in fairy tales,” the Count explained. “But I have  <i class="calibre3">dined</i> in a castle. . . .” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p48"></a>Accepting this response as sufficient, if not ideal, the girl now furrowed her brow. She put another quadrant of fish in her mouth and chewed thoughtfully. Then she suddenly leaned forward. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Have you ever been in a duel?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“An  <i class="calibre3">affaire d’honneur</i>?” The Count hesitated. “I suppose I have been in a duel of sorts. . . .” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“With pistols at thirty-two paces?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“In my case, it was more of a duel in the figurative sense.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">When the Count’s guest expressed her disappointment at this unfortunate clarification, he found himself offering a consolation:</p>
<p class="calibre1">“My godfather was a second on more than one occasion.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“A second?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“When a gentleman has been offended and demands satisfaction on the field of honor, he and his counterpart each appoint seconds—in essence, their lieutenants. It is the seconds who settle upon the rules of engagement.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What sort of rules of engagement?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The time and place of the duel. What weapons will be used. If it is to be pistols, then how many paces will be taken and whether there will be more than one exchange of shots.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Your godfather, you say. Where did  <i class="calibre3">he</i> live?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Here in Moscow.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Were his duels in Moscow?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“One of them was. In fact, it sprang from a dispute that occurred in this hotel—between an admiral and a prince. They had been at odds for quite some time, I gather, but things came to a head one night when their paths collided in the lobby, and the gauntlet was thrown down on that very spot.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Which very spot?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“By the concierge’s desk.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Right where I sit!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes, I suppose so.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Were they in love with the same woman?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I don’t think a woman was involved.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The girl looked at the Count with an expression of incredulity. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“A woman is always involved,” she said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes. Well. Whatever the cause, an offense was taken followed by a demand for an apology, a refusal to provide one, and a slap of the glove. At</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p49"></a><img class="calibre2" src="index-49_1.jpg"/></p>
<p class="calibre1">the time, the hotel was managed by a German fellow named Keffler, who was reputedly a baron in his own right. And it was generally known that he kept a pair of pistols hidden behind a panel in his office, so that when an incident occurred, seconds could confer in privacy, carriages could be summoned, and the feuding parties could be whisked away with weapons in hand.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“In the hours before dawn . . .” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“In the hours before dawn.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“To some remote spot . . .” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“To some remote spot.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">She leaned forward. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Lensky was killed by Onegin in a duel.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">She said this in a hushed voice, as if quoting the events of Pushkin’s poem required discretion. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes,” whispered back the Count. “And so was Pushkin.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">She nodded in grave agreement. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“In St. Petersburg,” she said. “On the banks of the Black Rivulet.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“On the banks of the Black Rivulet.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The young lady’s fish was now gone. Placing her napkin on her plate and nodding her head once to suggest how perfectly acceptable the Count had proven as a luncheon companion, she rose from her chair. But before turning to go, she paused. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I prefer you without your moustaches,” she said. “Their absence improves your . . . countenance.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Then she performed an off-kilter curtsey and disappeared behind the fountain. </p>
<p class="calibre1">An <i class="calibre3"> affaire d’honneur</i> <i class="calibre3">. . . </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">Or so thought the Count with a touch of self-recrimination as he sat alone later that night in the hotel’s bar with a snifter of brandy. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Situated off the lobby, furnished with banquettes, a mahogany bar, and a wall of bottles, this American-style watering hole was affectionately referred to by the Count as the Shalyapin, in honor of the great Russian opera singer who had frequented the spot in the years before the</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p50"></a>Revolution. Once a beehive of activity, the Shalyapin was now more a chapel of prayer and reflection—but tonight that suited the Count’s cast of mind. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Yes, he continued in his thoughts, how fine almost any human endeavor can be made to sound when expressed in the proper French. . . . </p>
<p class="calibre1">“May I offer you a hand, Your Excellency?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">This was Audrius, the Shalyapin’s tender at bar. A Lithuanian with a blond goatee and a ready smile, Audrius was a man who knew his business. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Why, the moment after you took a stool he would be leaning toward you with his forearm on the bar to ask your pleasure; and as soon as your glass was empty, he was there with a splash. But the Count wasn’t sure why he was choosing this particular moment to offer a hand. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“With your jacket,” the bartender clarified. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In point of fact, the Count did seem to be struggling to get his arm through the sleeve of his blazer—which he couldn’t quite remember having taken off in the first place. The Count had arrived at the Shalyapin at six o’clock, as usual, where he maintained a strict limit of one aperitif before dinner. But noting that he had never received his bottle of Baudelaire, the Count had allowed himself a second glass of Dubonnet. And then a snifter or two of brandy. And the next thing he knew, it was . . . , it was . . . </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What time  <i class="calibre3">is</i> it, Audrius?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Ten, Your Excellency.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Ten!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Audrius, who was suddenly on the customer side of the bar, was helping the Count off his stool. And as he guided the Count across the lobby (quite unnecessarily), the Count invited him into his train of thought. </p>

<p class="calibre1">“I did not know that, Your Excellency,” the bartender replied with a smile. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well, it’s quite true. And not only is a duel central to the action of <i class="calibre3">Onegin</i>, one occurs at a critical juncture in  <i class="calibre3">War and Peace, Fathers and</i> <i class="calibre3">Sons, </i> and  <i class="calibre3">The Brothers Karamazov</i>! Apparently, for all their powers of invention, the Russian masters could not come up with a better plot device</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p51"></a>than two central characters resolving a matter of conscience by means of pistols at thirty-two paces.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I see your point. But here we are. Shall I press for the fifth floor?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The Count, who found himself standing in front of the elevator, looked at the bartender in shock. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But, Audrius, I have never taken the lift in my life!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Then, after patting the bartender on the shoulder, the Count began winding his way up the stairs; that is, until he reached the second-floor landing, where he sat on a step. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Why is it that our nation above all others embraced the duel so wholeheartedly?” he asked the stairwell rhetorically. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Some, no doubt, would simply dismiss it as a by-product of barbarism. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Given Russia’s long, heartless winters, its familiarity with famine, its rough sense of justice, and so on, and so on, it was perfectly natural for its gentry to adopt an act of definitive violence as the means of resolving disputes. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But in the Count’s considered opinion, the reason that dueling prevailed among Russian gentlemen stemmed from nothing more than their passion for the glorious and grandiose. </p>
<p class="calibre1">True, duels were fought by convention at dawn in isolated locations to ensure the privacy of the gentlemen involved. But were they fought behind ash heaps or in scrapyards? Of course not! They were fought in a clearing among the birch trees with a dusting of snow. Or on the banks of a winding rivulet. Or at the edge of a family estate where the breezes shake the blossoms from the trees. . . . That is, they were fought in settings that one might have expected to see in the second act of an opera. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In Russia, whatever the endeavor, if the setting is glorious and the tenor grandiose, it will have its adherents. In fact, over the years, as the locations for duels became more picturesque and the pistols more finely manufactured, the best-bred men proved willing to defend their honor over lesser and lesser offenses. So while dueling may have begun as a response to high crimes—to treachery, treason, and adultery—by 1900 it had tiptoed down the stairs of reason, until they were being fought over the tilt of a hat, the duration of a glance, or the placement of a comma. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In the old and well-established code of dueling, it is understood that the number of paces the offender and offended take before shooting should be in inverse proportion to the magnitude of the insult. That is, the most</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p52"></a>reprehensible affront should be resolved by a duel of the fewest paces, to ensure that one of the two men will not leave the field of honor alive. Well, if that was the case, concluded the Count, then in the new era, the duels should have been fought at no less than ten thousand paces. In fact, having thrown down the gauntlet, appointed seconds, and chosen weapons, the offender should board a steamer bound for America as the offended boards another for Japan where, upon arrival, the two men could don their finest coats, descend their gangplanks, turn on the docks, and fire. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p53"></a> <i class="calibre3"><b class="calibre4">Anyway . . . </b></i></p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre4">F</b>ive days later, the Count was pleased to accept a formal invitation to tea from his new acquaintance, Nina Kulikova. The engagement was for three o’clock in the hotel’s coffeehouse at the northwest corner of the ground floor. Arriving at a quarter till, the Count claimed a table for two near the window. When at five past the hour his hostess arrived in the manner of a daffodil—wearing a light yellow dress with a dark yellow sash</p>
<p class="calibre1">—the Count rose and held out her chair. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“<i class="calibre3">Merci</i>,” she said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“<i class="calibre3">Je t’en prie. </i>” </p>
<p class="calibre1">In the minutes that followed, a waiter was signaled, a samovar was ordered, and with thunderclouds accumulating over Theatre Square, remarks were exchanged on the bittersweet likelihood of rain. But once the tea was poured and the tea cakes on the table, Nina adopted a more serious expression—intimating the time had come to speak of weightier concerns. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Some might have found this transition a little abrupt or out of keeping with the hour, but not the Count. Quite to the contrary, he thought a prompt dispensing of pleasantries and a quick shift to the business at hand utterly in keeping with the etiquette of tea—perhaps even essential to the institution. </p>
<p class="calibre1">After all, every tea the Count had ever attended in response to a formal invitation had followed this pattern. Whether it took place in a drawing room overlooking the Fontanka Canal or a teahouse in a public garden, before the first cake was sampled the  <i class="calibre3">purpose</i> of the invitation would be laid upon the table. In fact, after a few requisite pleasantries, the most accomplished of hostesses could signal the transition with a single word of her choosing. </p>
<p class="calibre1">For the Count’s grandmother, the word had been  <i class="calibre3">Now</i>, as in  <i class="calibre3">Now,</i> <i class="calibre3">Alexander. I have heard some very distressing things about you, my boy. . . . </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">For Princess Poliakova, a perennial victim of her own heart, it had been  <i class="calibre3">Oh, </i></p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p54"></a>as in  <i class="calibre3">Oh, Alexander. I have made a terrible mistake. . . . </i> And for young Nina, the word was apparently  <i class="calibre3">Anyway</i>, as in:</p>
<p class="calibre1">“You’re absolutely right, Alexander Ilyich. Another afternoon of rain and the lilac blossoms won’t stand a fighting chance. Anyway . . .” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Suffice it to say that when Nina’s tone shifted, the Count was ready. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Resting his forearms on his thighs and leaning forward at an angle of seventy degrees, he adopted an expression that was serious yet neutral, so that in an instant he could convey his sympathy, concern, or shared indignation as the circumstances required. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“. . . I would be ever so grateful,” Nina continued, “if you would share with me some of the rules of being a princess.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The rules?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes. The rules.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But, Nina,” the Count said with a smile, “being a princess is not a game.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nina stared at the Count with an expression of patience. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I am certain that you know what I mean. Those things that were <i class="calibre3">expected</i> of a princess.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Ah, yes. I see.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The Count leaned back to give his hostess’s inquiry a more appropriate consideration. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well,” he said after a moment, “setting aside the study of the liberal arts, which we discussed the other day, I suppose the rules of being a princess would begin with a refinement of manners. To that end, she would be taught how to comport herself in society; she would be taught terms of address, table manners, posture . . .” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Having nodded favorably at the various items on the Count’s list, Nina looked up sharply at the last one. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Posture? Is posture a type of manners?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes,” replied the Count, albeit a little tentatively, “it is. A slouching posture tends to suggest a certain laziness of character, as well as a lack of interest in others. Whereas an upright posture can confirm a sense of self-possession, and a quality of engagement—both of which are befitting of a princess.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Apparently swayed by this argument, Nina sat a little more upright. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Go on.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p55"></a>The Count reflected. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“A princess would be raised to show respect for her elders.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nina bowed her head toward the Count in deference. He coughed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I wasn’t referring to me, Nina. After all, I am practically a youth like yourself. No, by ‘elders,’ I meant the gray haired.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nina nodded to express her understanding. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You mean the grand dukes and grand duchesses.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well, yes. Certainly them. But I mean elders of every social class. The shopkeepers and milkmaids, blacksmiths and peasants.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Never hesitant to express her sentiments with facial expressions, Nina frowned. The Count elaborated. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The principle here is that a new generation owes a measure of thanks to <i class="calibre3">every</i> member of the previous generation. Our elders planted fields and fought in wars; they advanced the arts and sciences, and generally made sacrifices on our behalf. So by their efforts, however humble, they have earned a measure of our gratitude and respect.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">As Nina still looked unconvinced, the Count considered how best to make his point; and it so happened that at that very moment, through the great windows of the coffeehouse could be seen the first hoisting of umbrellas. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“An example,” he said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Thus commenced the story of Princess Golitsyn and the crone of Kudrovo:</p>
<p class="calibre1">One stormy night in St. Petersburg, related the Count, young Princess Golitsyn was on her way to the annual ball at the Tushins’. As her carriage crossed the Lomonosov Bridge, she happened to notice an eighty-year-old woman on foot, hunched against the rain. Without a second thought, she called for her driver to stop the carriage and invited the unfortunate soul inside. The old woman, who was nearly blind, climbed aboard with the footman’s help and thanked the Princess profusely. In the back of the Princess’s mind may well have been the presumption that her passenger lived nearby. After all, how far was an old, blind woman likely to journey on a night like this? But when the Princess asked where the old woman was headed, she replied that she was going to visit her son, the blacksmith, in Kudrovo—more than seven miles away! </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p56"></a>Now, the Princess was already expected at the Tushins’. And in a matter of minutes they would be passing the house—lit from cellar to ceiling with a footman on every step. So, it would have been well within the bounds of courtesy for the Princess to excuse herself and send the carriage on to Kudrovo with the old woman. In fact, as they approached the Tushins’, the driver slowed the horses and looked to the Princess for instruction. . . . </p>
<p class="calibre1">Here the Count paused for effect. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well,” Nina asked, “what did she do?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“She told him to drive on.” The Count smiled with a touch of triumph. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“And what is more, when they arrived in Kudrovo and the blacksmith’s family gathered round the carriage, the old woman invited the Princess in for tea. The blacksmith winced, the coachman gasped, and the footman nearly fainted. But Princess Golitsyn graciously accepted the old woman’s invitation—and missed the Tushins’ altogether.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">His point expertly made, the Count raised his own cup of tea, nodded once, and drank. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nina looked at him expectantly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“And then?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The Count returned his cup to its saucer. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“And then what?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Did she marry the blacksmith’s son?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Marry the blacksmith’s son! Good God. Certainly not. After a glass of tea she climbed into her carriage and headed for home.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nina mulled this over. Clearly, she thought a marriage to the blacksmith’s son a more fitting conclusion. But despite the shortcomings of history, she nodded to acknowledge that the Count had delivered a well-told tale. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Preferring to preserve his success, the Count opted not to share his normal coda to this delightful bit of St. Petersburg lore: that the Countess Tushin had been greeting guests under her portico when Princess Golitsyn’s bright blue carriage, known the city over, slowed before the gates and then sped on. This resulted in a rift between the Golitsyns and the Tushins that would have taken three generations to repair—if a certain Revolution hadn’t brought an end to their outrage altogether. . . . </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It was behavior befitting a princess,” acknowledged Nina. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Exactly,” said the Count. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p57"></a>Then he held out the tea cakes and Nina took two, putting one on her plate and one in her mouth. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The Count was not one to call attention to the social shortcomings of acquaintances, but giddy with his story’s reception, he could not resist pointing out with a smile:</p>
<p class="calibre1">“There is another example.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Where is another example?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“A princess would be raised to say  <i class="calibre3">please</i> when she asked for a cake, and  <i class="calibre3">thank you</i> when she was offered one.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nina looked taken aback; and then dismissive. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I can see that  <i class="calibre3">please</i> would be quite appropriate for a princess to say when she has asked for a cake; but I can see no reason why she should have to say  <i class="calibre3">thank you</i> when she has been offered one.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Manners are not like bonbons, Nina. You may not choose the ones that suit you best; and you certainly cannot put the half-bitten ones back in the box. . . .” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nina eyed the Count with an expression of seasoned tolerance, and then presumably for his benefit, spoke a little more slowly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I understand that a princess should say  <i class="calibre3">please</i> if she is asking for a cake, because she is trying to convince someone to give her the cake. And I suppose, if having asked for a cake, she is given a cake, then she has good reason to say  <i class="calibre3">thank you</i>. But in the second part of your example, the princess in question didn’t ask for the cake; she was  <i class="calibre3">offered</i> it. And I see no reason why she should have to say  <i class="calibre3">thank you</i> when she is merely obliging someone by accepting what they’ve offered.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">To punctuate her point, Nina put a lemon tartlet in her mouth. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I concede that there is some merit to your argument,” said the Count. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But I can only tell you from a life of experience that—” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nina cut him off with a wave of a finger. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But you have just said that you are quite young.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Indeed, I am.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well then, it seems to me that your claim of ‘a life of experience’ may be premature.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Yes, thought the Count, as this tea was making perfectly clear. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I shall work upon my posture,” Nina said quite definitively, brushing the crumbs from her fingers. “And I will be sure to say  <i class="calibre3">please</i> and  <i class="calibre3">thank</i></p>

<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3"><b class="calibre4">Around and About</b></i></p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre4">O</b>n the twelfth of July at seven o’clock, as the Count was crossing the lobby on his way to the Boyarsky, Nina caught his eye from behind one of the potted palms and gave him the signal. It was the first time that she had hailed him for an excursion this late in the day. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Quick,” she explained, when he had joined her behind the tree. “The gentleman has gone out to dine.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The gentleman? </p>
<p class="calibre1">To avoid drawing attention to themselves, the two walked casually up the stairs. But as they turned onto the third floor, they ran smack into a guest who was patting his pockets for his key. On the landing directly across from the elevator, there was a stained-glass window of long-legged birds wading in shallows that the Count had passed a thousand times before. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nina began to study it with care. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes, you were right,” she said. “It is some kind of crane.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">But as soon as the guest had let himself into his room, Nina forged ahead. Moving at a brisk pace along the carpet, they passed rooms 313, 314, and 315. They passed the little table with the statue of Hermes that stood outside the door of 316. Then with a certain dizziness, the Count realized that they were headed toward his old suite! </p>
<p class="calibre1">But wait. </p>
<p class="calibre1">We are ahead of ourselves. . . . </p>
<p class="calibre1">After the ill-fated night that ended on the second-floor steps, the Count had taken a break from his nightly aperitif, suspecting that the liquor had been an unhealthy influence on his mood. But this saintly abstinence did not prove a tonic to his soul. With so little to do and all the time in the world to</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p60"></a>do it, the Count’s peace of mind continued to be threatened by a sense of ennui—that dreaded mire of the human emotions. </p>
<p class="calibre1">And if this is how desultory one feels after three weeks, reflected the Count, then how desultory can one expect to feel after three years? </p>
<p class="calibre1">But for the virtuous who have lost their way, the Fates often provide a guide. On the island of Crete, Theseus had his Ariadne and her magical ball of thread to lead him safely from the lair of the Minotaur. Through those caverns where ghostly shadows dwell, Odysseus had his Tiresias just as Dante had his Virgil. And in the Metropol Hotel, Count Alexander Ilyich Rostov had a nine-year-old girl by the name of Nina Kulikova. </p>
<p class="calibre1">For on the first Wednesday in July, as the Count sat in the lobby at a loss of what to do with himself, he happened to notice Nina zipping past with an unusually determined expression. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Hello, my friend. Where are you headed?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Turning about like one who’s been caught in the act, Nina composed herself, then answered with a wave of the hand:</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Around and about . . .” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The Count raised his eyebrows. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“And where is that exactly?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">. . . </p>
<p class="calibre1">“At this moment, the card room.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Ah. So you like to play at cards.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Not really . . .” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Then why on earth are you going there?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">. . . </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh, come now,” the Count protested. “Surely, there are not going to be secrets between  <i class="calibre3">us</i>!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nina weighed the Count’s remark, then looking once to her left and once to her right, she confided. She explained that while the card room was rarely used, at three o’clock on Wednesdays four women met there without fail for a regular game of whist; and if you arrived by two thirty and hid in the cupboard, you could hear their every word—which included a good deal of cursing; and when the ladies left, you could eat the rest of their cookies. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The Count sat upright. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Where else do you spend your time?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Again she weighed the Count’s remark, looked left and looked right. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p61"></a><img class="calibre2" src="index-61_1.jpg"/></p>
<p class="calibre1">“Meet me here,” she said, “tomorrow at two.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">And thus began the Count’s education. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Having lived at the Metropol for four years, the Count considered himself something of an expert on the hotel. He knew its staff by name, its services by experience, and the decorative styles of its suites by heart. But once Nina had taken him in hand, he realized what a novice he had been. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In the ten months that Nina had lived at the Metropol, she had been confronted with her own version of confinement. For, as her father had been posted only “temporarily” to Moscow, he had not bothered to enroll her in school. And as Nina’s governess still had one foot set firmly in the hinterlands, she preferred that her charge remain on the hotel’s premises where she was less likely to be corrupted by street lamps and trolley cars. </p>
<p class="calibre1">So, if the door of the Metropol was known the world over for spinning without stop, it spun not for Nina. But, an enterprising and tireless spirit, the young lady had made the most of her situation by personally investigating the hotel until she knew every room, its purpose, and how it might be put to better use. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Yes, the Count had gone to the little window at the back of the lobby to ask for his mail, but had he been to the sorting room where the incoming envelopes were spilled on a table at ten and at two—including those that were stamped in red with the unambiguous instruction  <i class="calibre3">For Immediate</i> <i class="calibre3">Delivery</i>? </p>
<p class="calibre1">And yes, he had visited Fatima’s in the days when it was open, but had he been inside the cutting room? Through a narrow door at the back of her shop was that niche with a light green counter where stems had been snipped and roses dethorned, where even now one could find scattered across the floor the dried petals of ten perennials essential to the making of potions. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">Of course, </i> exclaimed the Count to himself. Within the Metropol there were rooms behind rooms and doors behind doors. The linen closets. The laundries. The pantries. The switchboard! </p>
<p class="calibre1">It was like sailing on a steamship. Having enjoyed an afternoon shooting clay pigeons off the starboard bow, a passenger dresses for dinner, dines at</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p62"></a><img class="calibre2" src="index-62_1.jpg"/></p>
<p class="calibre1">the captain’s table, outplays the cocky French fellow at baccarat, and then strolls under the stars on the arm of a new acquaintance—all the while congratulating himself that he has made the most of a journey at sea. But in point of fact, he has only exposed himself to a  <i class="calibre3">glimpse</i> of life on the ship—</p>
<p class="calibre1">having utterly ignored those lower levels that teem with life and make the passage possible. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nina had not contented herself with the views from the upper decks. She had gone below. Behind. Around. About. In the time that Nina had been in the hotel, the walls had not grown inward, they had grown outward, expanding in scope and intricacy. In her first weeks, the building had grown to encompass the life of two city blocks. In her first months, it had grown to encompass half of Moscow. If she lived in the hotel long enough, it would encompass all of Russia. </p>
<p class="calibre1">To initiate the Count’s course of study, Nina quite sensibly began at the bottom—the basement and its network of corridors and cul-de-sacs. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Tugging open a heavy steel door, she led him first into the boiler room, where billows of steam escaped from a concertina of valves. With the aid of the Count’s handkerchief, she gingerly opened a small cast-iron door in the furnace to reveal the fire that burned day and night, and which happened to be the best place in the hotel to destroy secret messages and illicit love letters. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You do receive illicit love letters, Count?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Most certainly.” </p>

<p class="calibre1">After a turn to the left and two to the right, they came to a small cluttered room—a sort of cabinet of curiosities—showcasing all the items that the hotel’s guests had left behind, such as umbrellas,  <i class="calibre3">Baedekers</i>, and the weighty novels they had yet to finish but could no longer bear to lug</p>
