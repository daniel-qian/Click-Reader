<body><p class="calibre1">footsteps that having quickly ascended two flights would suddenly stop, bang on his door, and breathlessly explain that two friends in a coach-and-four were waiting at the curb. (After all, isn’t that why the pages of books are numbered? To facilitate the finding of one’s place after a reasonable interruption?)</p>
<p class="calibre1">As to possessions, he hadn’t cared a whit about them. He was the first to lend a book or an umbrella to an acquaintance (never mind that no acquaintance since Adam had returned a book or an umbrella). </p>
<p class="calibre1">And routines? He had prided himself on never having one. He would breakfast at 10:00 A.M. one day and 2:00 P.M. the next. At his favorite restaurants, he had never ordered the same dish twice in a season. Rather, he traveled across their menus like Mr. Livingstone traveled across Africa and Magellan the seven seas. </p>
<p class="calibre1">No, at the age of twenty-two, Count Alexander Rostov could not be inconvenienced, interrupted, or unsettled. For every unexpected appearance, comment, or turn of events had been welcomed like a burst of fireworks in a summer sky—as something to be marveled at and cheered. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But apparently, this was no longer the case. . . . </p>
<p class="calibre1">The unanticipated arrival of a thirty-pound package had torn the veil from his eyes. Without his even noticing—without his acknowledgment, input, or permission—routine had established itself within his daily life. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Apparently, he now ate his breakfast at an appointed hour. Apparently, he must sip his coffee and nibble his biscuits without interruption. He must read in a particular chair tilted at a particular angle with no more than the scuffing of a pigeon’s feet to distract him. He must shave his right cheek, shave his left, and only then move on to the underside of his chin. </p>
<p class="calibre1">To that end, the Count now tilted back his head and raised his razor, but the change in the angle of his gaze revealed two fathomless eyes staring back at him from the reflection in the mirror. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Egads!” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p239"></a><img class="calibre2" src="index-239_1.jpg"/></p>
<p class="calibre1">“I have finished looking at the pictures,” she said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Which ones?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“All of them.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“All of them!” It was now the Count’s eyes that opened wide. “Well, isn’t that splendid.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I think this is for you,” she said, holding out a small envelope. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Where did that come from?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It was slipped under your door. . . .” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Taking the envelope in hand, the Count could tell that it was empty; but in place of an address, the query  <i class="calibre3">Three o’clock? </i> was written in a willowy script. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Ah, yes,” said the Count, stuffing it in his pocket. “A small matter of business.” Then he thanked Sofia in a manner indicating that she could now be on her way. </p>
<p class="calibre1">And she replied, “You’re welcome,” in a manner indicating that she had no intention of going anywhere. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Thus had the Count leapt from his bed and clapped his hands at the first chime of the noon hour. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Right,” he said. “How about some lunch? You must be famished. I think you will find the Piazza positively delightful. More than simply a restaurant, the Piazza was designed to be an extension of the city—of its gardens, markets, and thoroughfares.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">But as the Count continued with his description of the Piazza’s advantages, he noticed that Sofia was staring at his father’s clock with an expression of surprise. And when they passed over the threshold to go downstairs, she took another look back then hesitated—as if on the verge of asking how such a delicate device could generate such a lovely sound. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Well, thought the Count as he began to close the door, if she wanted to know the secrets of the twice-tolling clock, she had come to the right place <i class="calibre3">. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">For not only did the Count know something of chronometry, he knew absolutely everything there was to know about this particular—</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Uncle Alexander,” Sofia said in the tender tone of one who must deliver unhappy news. “I fear your clock is broken.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p240"></a><img class="calibre2" src="index-240_1.jpg"/></p>
<p class="calibre1">Taken aback, the Count released his grip on the doorknob. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Broken? No, no, I assure you, Sofia, my clock keeps  <i class="calibre3">perfect</i> time. In fact, it was made by craftsmen known the world over for their commitment to precision.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It isn’t the timekeeper that is broken,” she explained. “It is the chime.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But it just chimed beautifully.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes. It chimed at  <i class="calibre3">noon</i>. But it failed to chime at nine and ten and eleven.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Ah,” the Count said with a smile. “Normally, you would be perfectly right, my dear. But, you see, this is a twice-tolling clock. It was made many years ago to my father’s specifications to toll only twice a day.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But why?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Why indeed, my friend, why indeed. I’ll tell you what. Let us adjourn to the Piazza where—having placed our order and made ourselves comfortable—we shall investigate all the whys and wherefores of my father’s clock. For there is nothing more essential to the enjoyment of a civilized lunch than to have a lively topic of conversation.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">At 12:10 the Piazza was not yet bustling; but perhaps this was just as well, as the Count and Sofia received an excellent table and prompt attention from Martyn—a capable new waiter who pulled back Sofia’s chair with an admirable sense of politesse. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“My niece,” explained the Count, as Sofia looked around the room in amazement. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I have a six-year-old of my own,” Martyn replied with a smile. “I’ll give you a moment.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Granted, Sofia was not so unworldly as to be unfamiliar with elephants, but she had never seen anything quite like the Piazza. Not only was she marveling at the room’s scale and elegance, but at each of the individual elements that seemed to turn common sense on its head: A ceiling made of glass. A tropical garden indoors. A fountain in the middle of a room! </p>
<p class="calibre1">When Sofia completed her survey of the Piazza’s paradoxes, she seemed to understand instinctively that such a setting deserved an elevated standard of behavior. For she suddenly took her doll off the table and placed it on the</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p241"></a>empty chair to her right; when the Count slipped his napkin out from under his silverware to place it in his lap, Sofia followed suit, taking particular care not to jangle her fork and knife; and when, having placed their order with Martyn, the Count said  <i class="calibre3">Thank you so much, my good man</i>, Sofia echoed the Count word for word. Then she looked to the Count, expectantly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Now?” she asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Now what, my dear?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Is now when you will tell me about the twice-tolling clock?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh, yes. Precisely.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">But where to start? </p>
<p class="calibre1">Naturally enough, at the beginning. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The twice-tolling clock, the Count explained, had been commissioned by his father from the venerable firm of Breguet. Establishing their shop in Paris in 1775, the Breguets were quickly known the world over not only for the precision of their chronometers (that is, the accuracy of their clocks), but for the elaborate means by which their clocks could signal the passage of time. They had clocks that played a few measures of Mozart at the end of the hour. They had clocks that chimed not only at the hour but at the half and the quarter. They had clocks that displayed the phases of the moon, the progress of the seasons, and the cycle of the tides. But when the Count’s father visited their shop in 1882, he posed a very different sort of challenge for the firm: a clock that tolled only twice a day. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“<i class="calibre3">Why</i> would he do so?” asked the Count (in anticipation of his young listener’s favorite interrogative). </p>
<p class="calibre1">Quite simply, the Count’s father had believed that while a man should attend closely to life, he should not attend too closely to the clock. A student of both the Stoics and Montaigne, the Count’s father believed that our Creator had set aside the morning hours for industry. That is, if a man woke no later than six, engaged in a light repast, and then applied himself without interruption, by the hour of noon he should have accomplished a full day’s labor. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Thus, in his father’s view, the toll of twelve was a moment of reckoning. </p>
<p class="calibre1">When the noon bell sounded, the diligent man could take pride in having made good use of the morning and sit down to his lunch with a clear conscience. But when it sounded for the frivolous man—the man who had</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p242"></a>squandered his morning in bed, or on breakfast with three papers, or on idle chatter in the sitting room—he had no choice but to ask for his Lord’s forgiveness. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In the afternoon, the Count’s father believed that a man should take care not to live by the watch in his waistcoat—marking the minutes as if the events of one’s life were stations on a railway line. Rather, having been suitably industrious before lunch, he should spend his afternoon in wise liberty. That is, he should walk among the willows, read a timeless text, converse with a friend beneath the pergola, or reflect before the fire—</p>
<p class="calibre1">engaging in those endeavors that have no appointed hour, and that dictate their own beginnings and ends. </p>
<p class="calibre1">And the second chime? </p>
<p class="calibre1">The Count’s father was of the mind that one should never hear it. If one had lived one’s day well—in the service of industry, liberty, and the Lord—</p>
<p class="calibre1">one should be soundly asleep long before twelve. So the second chime of the twice-tolling clock was most definitely a remonstrance.  <i class="calibre3">What are </i> you <i class="calibre3">doing up? </i> it was meant to say.  <i class="calibre3">Were you so profligate with your daylight</i> <i class="calibre3">that you must hunt about for things to do in the dark? </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">“Your veal.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Ah. Thank you, Martyn.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Quite appropriately, Martyn placed the first dish before Sofia and the second before the Count. Then he lingered a little closer to the table than was necessary. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Thank you,” the Count said again in a polite sign of dismissal. But as the Count took up his silverware and began recalling for Sofia’s benefit how he and his sister would sit by the twice-tolling clock on the last night of December in order to ring in the New Year, Martyn took a step even closer. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes?” asked the Count, somewhat impatiently. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Martyn hesitated. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Shall I . . . cut the young lady’s meat?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The Count looked across the table to where Sofia, fork in hand, was staring at her plate. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">Mon Dieu, </i> thought the Count. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No need, my friend. I shall see to it.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p243"></a>As Martyn backed away with a bow, the Count circled the table and in a few quick strokes had cut Sofia’s veal into eight pieces. Then, on the verge of setting down her cutlery, he cut the eight pieces into sixteen. By the time he had returned to his seat, she had already eaten four. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Having regained her energy through sustenance, Sofia now unleashed a cavalcade of  <i class="calibre3">Whys</i>. Why was it better to commune with work in the morning and nature in the afternoon? Why would a man read three newspapers? Why should one walk under the willows rather than some other sort of tree? And what was a pergola? Which in turn led to additional inquiries regarding Idlehour, the Countess, and Helena. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In principle, the Count generally regarded a barrage of interrogatives as bad form. Left to themselves, the words  <i class="calibre3">who</i>,  <i class="calibre3">what</i>,  <i class="calibre3">why</i>,  <i class="calibre3">when</i>, and  <i class="calibre3">where</i> do not a conversation make. But as the Count began to answer Sofia’s litany of queries, sketching the layout of Idlehour on the tablecloth with the tines of his fork, describing the personalities of family members and referencing various traditions—he noticed that Sofia was entirely, absolutely, and utterly engaged. What elephants and princesses had failed to accomplish, the life at Idlehour had apparently achieved. And just like that, her veal was gone. </p>
<p class="calibre1">When the plates had been cleared away, Martyn reappeared to inquire if they would be having dessert. The Count looked to Sofia with a smile, assuming that she would leap at the chance. But she bit her lower lip and shook her head. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Are you quite sure?” the Count asked. “Ice cream? Cookies? A piece of cake?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">But shifting a bit in her chair, she shook her head again. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Enter the new generation, thought the Count with a shrug, while returning the dessert menu to Martyn. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Apparently, we are done.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Martyn accepted the menu, but once again lingered. Then, turning his back slightly to the table, he actually leaned over with the clear intention of whispering in the Count’s ear. </p>
<p class="calibre1">For goodness sake, thought the Count. What now? </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Count Rostov, I believe that your niece . . . may need to go.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Go? Go where?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Martyn hesitated. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p244"></a>“To the privy . . .” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The Count looked up at the waiter and then at Sofia. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Say no more, Martyn.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The waiter bowed and excused himself. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Sofia,” the Count suggested tentatively, “shall we visit the ladies’</p>
<p class="calibre1">room?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Still biting her lip, Sofia nodded. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Do you need me to . . . accompany you inside?” he asked, after leading her down the hallway. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Sofia shook her head and disappeared behind the washroom door. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As he waited, the Count chastised himself for his lug-headedness. Not only had he failed to cut her meat and bring her to the ladies’ room, he clearly hadn’t thought to help her unpack, because she was wearing the exact same clothes she had worn the day before. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“And you call yourself a waiter . . . ,” he said to himself. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A moment later, Sofia emerged, looking relieved. But then, despite her readily apparent love of interrogatives, she hesitated like one who is struggling with whether to ask a question. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What is it, my dear? Is there something on your mind?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Sofia struggled for another moment, then worked up the nerve:</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Can we still have dessert, Uncle Alexander?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Now, it was the Count who looked relieved. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Without a doubt, my dear. Without a doubt.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p245"></a> <i class="calibre3"><b class="calibre4">Ascending, Alighting</b></i></p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre4">A</b>t two o’clock, when Marina answered her office door to find the Count at the threshold in the company of a little girl with a rag doll gripped tightly by the neck, she was so surprised her eyes almost came into alignment. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Ah, Marina,” said the Count, raising his eyebrows meaningfully. “You remember Nina Kulikova? May I present her daughter, Sofia. She will be staying with us in the hotel for a bit. . . .” </p>
<p class="calibre1">As a mother of two, Marina did not need the Count’s signal to tell her that something weighty had occurred in the life of the child. But she could also see that the girl was curious about the whirring sound coming from the other end of the room. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What a pleasure to meet you, Sofia,” she said. “I knew your mother well when she was just a few years older than you are now. But tell me: Have you ever seen a sewing machine?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Sofia shook her head. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well then. Come and let me show you one.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Offering Sofia her hand, Marina led the girl to the other side of the room, where her assistant was mending a royal blue drape. Dropping down so that she would be at Sofia’s level, Marina pointed to various parts of the machine and explained their use. Then, asking the young seamstress to show Sofia their collection of fabrics and buttons, she came back to the Count with an expression of inquiry. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In a hushed voice, he quickly recounted the events of the previous day. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You can see the predicament that I’m in,” concluded the Count. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I can see the predicament that Sofia is in,” corrected Marina. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes. You’re absolutely right,” the Count admitted contritely. Then, just as he was about to continue, he had a notion—a notion so inspired, it was incredible he hadn’t thought of it before. “I came, Marina, to see if you’d be</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p246"></a><img class="calibre2" src="index-246_1.jpg"/></p>
<p class="calibre1">willing to watch Sofia for an hour while I am at the Boyarsky’s daily meeting. . . .” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Of course I will,” said Marina. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“As I say, I came with that intention. . . . But as you have so rightly pointed out, it is Sofia who deserves our support and consideration. And watching you together just now, seeing your instinctive tenderness, and seeing the way that she felt instantly at ease in your company, it was suddenly so obvious that what she needs, especially at this juncture in her life, is a mother’s touch, a mother’s way, a mother’s—” </p>
<p class="calibre1">But Marina cut him off. And from the bottom of her heart, she said:</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Do not ask that of me, Alexander Ilyich. Ask it of yourself.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">I can do this</i>, said the Count to himself as he skipped up the stairs to the Boyarsky. After all, it was really just a matter of making some minor adjustments—a rearranging of some furniture and a shifting of some habits. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Since Sofia was too young to be left alone, he would eventually need to find someone who could sit with her while he was at work. For tonight, he would simply request an evening off, suggesting that his tables be divided between Denis and Dmitry. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But in an extraordinary example of a friend anticipating the needs of a friend, when the Count arrived at the meeting of the Triumvirate a few minutes late, Andrey said:</p>
<p class="calibre1">“There you are, Alexander. Emile and I were just discussing that Denis and Dmitry can share your tables tonight.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Collapsing into his chair, the Count let out a sigh of relief. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Perfect,” he said. “By tomorrow, I shall have come up with a longer-term solution.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The chef and the maître d’ looked at the Count in confusion. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“A longer-term solution?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Weren’t you splitting my tables so that I could be free for the evening?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Free for the evening!” gasped Andrey. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Emile guffawed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Alexander, my friend, it’s the third Saturday of the month. You’ll be expected in the Yellow Room at ten. . . .” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p247"></a><img class="calibre2" src="index-247_1.jpg"/></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">Mein Gott, </i> thought the Count. He had completely forgotten. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“. . . What’s more, the GAZ dinner is in the Red Room at half past seven.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The director of  <i class="calibre3">Gorkovsky Avtomobilny Zavod</i>, the state’s leading automotive manufacturing agency, was hosting a formal dinner to commemorate their fifth anniversary. In addition to key staff members, the event was to be attended by the Commissar of Heavy Industry, and three representatives of the Ford Motor Company—who didn’t speak a word of Russian. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I shall see to it personally,” said the Count. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Good,” said the maître d’. “Dmitry has already set up the room.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Then he slid two envelopes across the table to the Count. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In accordance with Bolshevik custom, the tables in the Red Room had been laid out in the shape of a long U with chairs arranged on the outer perimeter</p>

<p class="calibre1">Removing the third envelope, the Count considered it with a furrowed brow. That is, until he turned it over and saw the willowy script. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Great Scott!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">According to the clock on the wall, it was already 3:15. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The Count dashed out of the Red Room, down the hall, and up a flight of stairs. Finding the door to suite 311 ajar, he slipped inside, closed the door, and crossed the grand salon. In the bedroom, a silhouette turned from the window as her dress fell to the floor with a delicate whoosh. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The Count replied with a slight cough. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Anna, my love . . .” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p248"></a><img class="calibre2" src="index-248_1.jpg"/></p>
<p class="calibre1">Noting the expression on the Count’s face, the actress pulled her dress back up toward her shoulders. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’m terribly sorry, but due to a confluence of unexpected events, I am not going to be able to keep our appointment today. In fact, for related reasons, I may need to ask a small favor. . . .” </p>
<p class="calibre1">In the fifteen years that they had known each other, the Count had only asked Anna for one favor, and that had weighed less than two ounces. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Of course, Alexander,” she replied. “What is it?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“How many suitcases do you travel with?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">A few minutes later, the Count was hurrying down the staff stairwell—two Parisian traveling cases in hand. With renewed respect, he thought of Grisha and Genya and all their predecessors. For though Anna’s cases had been fashioned from the finest materials, they seemed to have been designed without the slightest consideration for having to be carried. The little leather handles were so small one could barely slip two fingers through them; and the cases’ dimensions were so generous that at every step they banged from the banister into one’s knee. How could the bellhops possibly manage to carry these things around so effortlessly? And often with a hatbox thrown in for good measure! </p>

<p class="calibre1">This had seemed an excellent idea to the Count when it had struck him, but the mattress was decidedly against it. When he bent over to lift the mattress from the bedsprings, it crossed its arms, held its breadth, and refused to budge. When he managed to get it upright, it immediately flopped over his head, nearly knocking him off his feet. And when he’d finally dragged it down the hall and flumped it in his room, it spread out its limbs, claiming every spare inch of the floor. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p249"></a><img class="calibre2" src="index-249_1.jpg"/></p>
<p class="calibre1">This will not do, thought the Count with his hands on his hips. If he left the mattress there, how were they to move about? And he certainly wasn’t going to drag it in and out of the room on a daily basis. But in a flash of inspiration, the Count was reminded of that morning sixteen years before, when he had consoled himself that living in this room would provide the satisfactions of traveling by train. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Yes, he thought. That is it, exactly <i class="calibre3">. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">Lifting the mattress onto its edge, he leaned it against the wall and warned it to stay put, if it knew what was good for it. Then he took Anna’s suitcases and ran down four flights to the pantry of the Boyarsky, where the canned tomatoes were stored. With an approximate height of eight inches and a diameter of six, they were perfectly suited to the task. So having lugged them back upstairs (with a healthy measure of huffing and puffing), he stacked, hoisted, pulled, and perched until the room was ready. Then, having returned Anna’s cases, he dashed down the stairs. </p>
<p class="calibre1">When the Count arrived at Marina’s office (more than an hour late), he was relieved to find the seamstress and Sofia seated on the floor in close consultation. Bounding up, Sofia held out her doll, which was now in a royal blue dress with little black buttons down the front. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Do you see what we made for Dolly, Uncle Alexander?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“How lovely!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“She is quite a seamstress,” said Marina. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Sofia hugged Marina and then skipped into the hall with her newly attired companion. The Count began to follow his charge, but Marina called him back. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Alexander: What arrangements have you made for Sofia while you are at work tonight . . . ?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The Count bit his lip. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“All right,” she said. “I will stay with her this evening. But tomorrow, you need to find someone else. You should speak with one of the younger chambermaids. Perhaps Natasha. She is unmarried and would be good with children. But you have to pay her a reasonable wage.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p250"></a>“Natasha,” confirmed the Count with gratitude. “I’ll speak to her first thing tomorrow. And a reasonable wage, absolutely. Thank you so much, Marina. I’ll send you and Sofia dinner from the Boyarsky around seven; and if last night is any indication, she will be sound asleep by nine.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The Count turned to go, then turned back again. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“And, I’m sorry about earlier. . . .” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It’s all right, Alexander. You were anxious because you haven’t spent time with children before. But I am certain that you are up to the challenge. </p>
<p class="calibre1">If you are ever in doubt, just remember that unlike adults, children  <i class="calibre3">want</i> to be happy. So they still have the ability to take the greatest pleasure in the simplest things.” By way of example, the seamstress placed something small and seemingly insignificant in the Count’s hand with an assurance and a few words of instruction. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As a result, when the Count and Sofia had climbed the five flights back to their rooms and she had turned her deep blue gaze of expectation upon him, the Count was ready. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Would you like to play a game?” he asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I would,” she said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Then come this way.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">With a touch of ceremony, the Count ushered Sofia through the closet door into the study. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Ooo,” she said as she emerged on the other side. “Is this your secret room?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It is  <i class="calibre3">our</i> secret room,” the Count replied. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Sofia nodded gravely to show that she understood. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But then children understand the purpose of secret rooms better than they understand the purpose of congresses, courtrooms, and banks. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Somewhat shyly, Sofia pointed at the painting. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Is that your sister?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes. Helena.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I like peaches too.” She ran a hand along the coffee table. “Is this where your grandma had tea?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Exactly.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Sofia nodded gravely again. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I am ready for the game.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p251"></a>“All right then. Here’s how we play. You will go back into the bedroom and count to two hundred. I shall remain in order to hide  <i class="calibre3">this</i> within the boundaries of the study.” Then, as if from thin air, the Count produced the silver thimble that Marina had given him. “Sofia, you do know how to count to two hundred?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No,” she admitted. “But I can count to one hundred twice.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well done.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Sofia exited through the closet, pulling the door shut behind her. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The Count glanced about the room in search of an appropriate spot—</p>
<p class="calibre1">one that would prove reasonably challenging for the child without taking unfair advantage of her age. After a few minutes of consideration, he approached the little bookcase and carefully placed the thimble on top of <i class="calibre3">Anna Karenina</i>; then he took a seat. </p>
<p class="calibre1">At the count of two hundred, the closet door opened a crack. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Are you ready?” she asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Indeed, I am.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">When Sofia came in, the Count expected her to scamper about the room willy-nilly, looking every which way. Instead, she remained in the doorway and quietly, almost unsettlingly, studied the room from quadrant to quadrant. Upper left, lower left, upper right, lower right. Then without a word, she walked straight to the bookcase and picked the thimble off the top of Tolstoy. This had occurred in less time than it would have taken for the Count to count to one hundred once. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well done,” said the Count, not meaning it. “Let’s play again.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Sofia handed the Count the thimble. But as soon as she left the room, the Count chastised himself for not having considered his next hiding place before initiating the second round. Now he had only two hundred seconds to find a suitable spot. As if to unnerve him further, Sofia began counting so loudly that he could hear her through the closed closet door. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Twenty-one, twenty-two, twenty-three . . .” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Suddenly it was the Count who was scampering about willy-nilly and looking every which way—discarding this spot for being too easy and that spot for being too hard. In the end, he tucked the thimble under the handle of the Ambassador—on the other side of the room from the bookcase. </p>
<p class="calibre1">When Sofia returned, she followed the same procedure as before. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Although, as if anticipating the Count’s petty little trick, this time she began</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p252"></a>her survey in the corner opposite from where she had found the thimble in the first round. It took her all of twenty seconds to pluck it from its hiding place. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Clearly, the Count had underestimated his adversary. But by placing the thimble in such low locations, he had been playing to Sofia’s natural strengths. In the next round, he would take advantage of her limitations by hiding it six or seven feet off the ground. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Again?” he said with the smile of a fox. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It’s your turn.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What’s that?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It is your turn to look, and my turn to hide.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No, you see, in this game I always do the hiding and you always do the hunting.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Sofia studied the Count as her mother would have. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“If you  <i class="calibre3">always</i> do the hiding and I  <i class="calibre3">always</i> do the hunting, then it wouldn’t be a game at all.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The Count frowned at the indisputability of this point of view. And when she held out her hand, he dutifully placed the thimble in her palm. As if this turnabout weren’t enough, when he reached for the doorknob, she tugged at his sleeve. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Uncle Alexander, you won’t peek, will you?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Won’t peek? The Count had a mind to say a word or two about the integrity of the Rostovs. Instead, he composed himself. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No, Sofia. I will not peek.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You promise . . . ?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">. . . </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I promise.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The Count went out into the bedroom muttering something about his word being his bond and never having cheated at cards or welched on a wager, and then he began to count. As he proceeded past 150, he could hear Sofia moving around the study, and when he reached 175, he heard a chair being pushed across the floor. Well aware of the difference between a gentleman and a cad, the Count counted until the room fell silent—that is, all the way to 222. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Ready or not,” he called. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p253"></a>When he came into the room, Sofia was sitting in one of the high-back chairs. </p>
<p class="calibre1">With a bit of theatricality, the Count put his hands behind his back and circled the room while saying  <i class="calibre3">hmmm</i>. But after two circuits, the little silver thimble had yet to reveal itself. So he began to search a bit more in earnest. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Taking a page from Sofia’s book, he divided the room into quadrants and reviewed them systematically, but to no avail. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Recalling that he had heard one of the chairs being moved, and accounting for Sofia’s height and arm extension, the Count estimated that she could have reached a spot at least five feet off the ground. So, he looked behind the frame of his sister’s portrait; he looked under the mechanics of the little window; he even looked above the doorframe. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Still no thimble. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Occasionally, he would look back at Sofia in the hopes that she would give herself away by glancing at her hiding place. But she maintained an infuriatingly disinterested expression, as if she hadn’t the slightest awareness of the hunt that was underway. And all the while, swinging her little feet back and forth. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As a student of psychology, the Count decided he must attempt to solve the problem from his opponent’s point of view. Just as he had wanted to take advantage of her limited height, perhaps she had taken advantage of his stature.  <i class="calibre3">Of course, </i> he thought. The sound of moving furniture didn’t have to mean that she was climbing up on a chair; it could have been her pulling something aside in order to hide something  <i class="calibre3">beneath</i> it. The Count dropped to the floor and crawled like a lizard from the bookcase to the Ambassador and back again. </p>
<p class="calibre1">And still she sat there swinging her little feet. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Could it be? </p>
<p class="calibre1">Was he, a Rostov, preparing to surrender? </p>
<p class="calibre1">Well, in a word: Yes. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p254"></a>There were no two ways about it. He had been bested and he knew it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Naturally, there would have to be a word or two of self-recrimination, but first he cursed Marina and the alleged pleasures of simple games. He breathed deeply and exhaled. Then he presented himself to Sofia as General Mack had presented himself to Napoleon, having let the Russian army slip through his grasp. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well done, Sofia,” he said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Sofia looked directly at the Count for the first time since he’d come into the room. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Are you giving up?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I am conceding,” said the Count. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Is that the same as giving up?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">. . . </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes, it is the same as giving up.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Then you should say so.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Naturally. His humiliation must be brought to its full realization. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I give up,” he said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Without a hint of gloating, Sofia accepted his surrender. Then she jumped off her chair and walked toward him. He stepped a little out of her way, assuming that she must have hid the thimble somewhere in the bookcase. But she didn’t approach the bookcase. Instead, she stopped in front of him, reached into his jacket pocket, and withdrew the thimble. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The Count was aghast. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In fact, he actually sputtered. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But, but, but, Sofia—that’s not fair!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Sofia studied the Count with curiosity. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Why is it not fair?” </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">Always with that damnable Why. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">“Because it’s not,” replied the Count. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But you said we could hide it anywhere in the room.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That’s just it, Sofia. My pocket wasn’t in the room.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Your pocket was in the room when I hid the thimble; and it was in the room when you hunted. . . .” </p>
<p class="calibre1">And as the Count gazed into her innocent little face, it all became clear. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He, a master of nuance and sleight of hand, had been played at every turn. </p>
<p class="calibre1">When she had called him back to insist he not peek and had so sweetly</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p255"></a><img class="calibre2" src="index-255_1.jpg"/></p>
<p class="calibre1"><img class="calibre2" src="index-255_2.jpg"/></p>
<p class="calibre1">tugged at his sleeve, that was a ploy to mask the slipping of the thimble into his pocket. And the moving of the furniture as the two-hundredth second approached? Pure theater. A ruthless case of dissembling. And even as he searched, there she sat, clutching her little Dolly in its bright blue dress, without ever once betraying her wiles. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The Count took one step back and bowed at the waist. </p>
<p class="calibre1">At six o’clock, having descended to the ground floor to deliver Sofia into Marina’s care, returned up to the sixth floor to retrieve Sofia’s doll, and then down to the ground floor to deliver it, the Count proceeded to the Boyarsky. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Apologizing to Andrey for being late, he quickly assessed his team, reviewed the tables, adjusted the glasses, aligned the silver, took a peek at Emile, and finally gave the signal that the restaurant could be opened. At half past seven, he went to the Red Room to oversee the GAZ dinner. Then at ten, he headed down the hall to where the doors of the Yellow Room were being guarded by a Goliath. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ever since 1930, the Count and Osip had been dining together on the third Saturday of the month in order to further the former Red Army colonel’s understanding of the West. </p>


<p class="calibre1">Osip had been somewhat intimidated by its length, but the Count had assured him that there was no better text with which to establish a</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p256"></a>fundamental understanding of American culture. So, the former colonel had burned the midnight oil for three weeks and arrived in the Yellow Room with the eagerness of the well-prepared schoolboy at his baccalaureate. And having seconded the Count’s fondness for summer nights, echoed his compliments on the  <i class="calibre3">sauce</i> <i class="calibre3">au poivre</i>, and shared his appreciation of the claret’s nose, Osip was itching to get down to business. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It is indeed a lovely wine, a lovely steak, and a lovely summer night,” </p>
<p class="calibre1">he said. “But shouldn’t we be shifting our attention to the book?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes, certainly,” said the Count, setting down his glass. “Let us turn our attention to the book. Why don’t you start us off. . . .” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well, first I’d have to say that it’s no  <i class="calibre3">Call of the Wild</i>.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No,” said the Count with a smile. “It is certainly no  <i class="calibre3">Call of the Wild</i>.” </p>

<p class="calibre1">“Yes.” The Count nodded sagely. “The first volume may well be characterized as detailed to a fault. . . .” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But the second volume—on the characteristics of their society—I found to be absolutely fascinating.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“In that, you are not alone.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“In fact, right from the first line . . . Wait. Where is it? Here we are: <i class="calibre3">There is not, I think, a single country in the civilized world where less</i> <i class="calibre3">attention is paid to philosophy than in the United States</i>. Ha! That should tell us a thing or two.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Quite so,” said the Count with a chuckle. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“And here. A few chapters later, he singles out their unusual passion for material well-being. The minds of Americans, he says,  <i class="calibre3">are universally</i> <i class="calibre3">preoccupied with meeting the body’s every need and attending to life’s little</i> <i class="calibre3">comforts</i>. And that was in 1840. Imagine if he had visited them in the 1920s!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Ha. Visited them in the 1920s. Well put, my friend.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But tell me, Alexander: What are we to make of his assertion that democracy is particularly suited to industry?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The Count leaned back in his chair and moved about his utensils. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes. The question of industry. That is an excellent place to dig in, Osip. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Right at the heart of it. What do you make of it?” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p257"></a>“But I was asking what you made of it, Alexander.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“And you shall hear what I think without fail. But as your tutor, I would be remiss were I to skew your impressions before you had the chance to formulate them yourself. So let us begin with the freshness of your thoughts.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Osip studied the Count, who in turn reached for his glass of wine. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Alexander . . . You have read the book. . . .” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Of course I have read the book,” confirmed the Count, putting down his glass. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I mean, you have read both volumes—to the very last page.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Osip, my friend, it is a fundamental rule of academic study that whether a student has read every word of a work matters less than whether he has established a reasonable familiarity with its essential material.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“And to which page does your reasonable familiarity extend in this particular work?” </p>


<p class="calibre1">shattering the glass and falling to the floor with a thud. The door to the Yellow Room flew open and the Goliath leapt inside with his firearm drawn. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Gadzooks!” exclaimed the Count, raising his hands above his head. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Osip, on the verge of commanding his bodyguard to shoot his tutor, took a deep breath, then simply shook his head. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It’s all right, Vladimir.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Vladimir nodded once and returned to his station in the hall. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Osip folded his hands on the table and looked at the Count, waiting for an explanation. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I am so sorry,” the Count said in genuine embarrassment. “I meant to finish it, Osip. In fact, I had cleared my calendar today in order to read the rest, when . . . circumstances intervened.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Circumstances.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Unexpected circumstances.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What sort of unexpected circumstances?” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p258"></a>“A young lady.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“A young lady!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The daughter of an old friend. She appeared out of the blue, and will be staying with me for a spell.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Osip looked at the Count as if dumbfounded, then let out a laugh. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well, well, well. Alexander Ilyich. A young lady staying with you. </p>

<p class="calibre1">“Actually . . . she’s a very young lady.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">. . . </p>
<p class="calibre1">“How young a lady?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Five or six?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Five or six!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’d say almost certainly six.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You are hosting an almost certainly six-year-old.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes . . .” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“In your room.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Precisely.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“For how long?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“A few weeks. Maybe a month. But no more than two . . .” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Osip smiled and nodded his head. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I see.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“To be perfectly honest,” the Count admitted, “so far her visit has been a little disruptive to the daily routine. But that’s to be expected, I suppose, given that she has only just arrived. Once we’ve made some minor adjustments and she has had a chance to acclimatize, then everything should go back to running without a hitch.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Without a doubt,” agreed Osip. “In the meantime, don’t let me keep you.” </p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="p259"></a><img class="calibre2" src="index-259_1.jpg"/></p>
<p class="calibre1">Did he remember those days when his children were almost certainly six? When there was a pitter-pat in the hallways an hour before dawn? </p>
<p class="calibre1">When every object smaller than an apple was nowhere to be found, until it was right underfoot? When books went unread, letters unanswered, and every train of thought was left incomplete? He remembered them as if they were yesterday. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Without a doubt,” he said again with a smile on his face: “Once they have made some minor adjustments, everything should go back to running without a hitch . . .” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The Count was generally of a mind that grown men should not run in hallways. But when he left Osip it was nearly eleven, and he had already taken ample advantage of Marina’s good nature. So, making an exception just this once, he sprinted down the hall, around the corner, and ran smack into some fellow with a ragged beard who was pacing at the top of the stairs. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Mishka!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Ah. There you are, Sasha.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The instant the Count recognized his old friend, his first thought was that he would have to send him on his way. What else was he to do? There were no two ways about it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But when he got a good look at Mishka’s face, he could tell that this was impossible. Something of significance had clearly occurred. So, instead of sending him on his way, the Count led him back up to his study where, having taken a seat, Mishka turned his hat in his hands. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Weren’t you scheduled to arrive in Moscow tomorrow?” the Count ventured after a brief silence. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes,” said Mishka with a careless wave of his hat. “But I came a day early at Shalamov’s request. . . .” </p>
<p class="calibre1">An acquaintance from their university days, Viktor Shalamov was now the senior editor at  <i class="calibre3">Goslitizdat</i>. It was his idea to have Mishka edit their forthcoming volumes of Anton Chekhov’s collected letters—a project that Mishka had been slaving over since 1934. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p260"></a>“Ah,” said the Count brightly. “You must be nearly done.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Nearly done,” Mishka repeated with a laugh. “You’re quite right, Sasha. I am nearly done. In fact, all that remains is to remove a word.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Here is what had unfolded:</p>
<p class="calibre1">Early that morning, Mikhail Mindich had arrived in Moscow on the overnight train from Leningrad. With the galleys on their way to the printer, Shalamov had said he wanted to take Mishka to the Central House of Writers for a celebratory lunch. But when Mishka arrived in the publisher’s reception room shortly before one o’clock, Shalamov asked him to come back to his office. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Once they were settled, Shalamov congratulated Mishka on a job well done. Then he patted the galleys that, as it turned out, were not on their way to the printer, but were lying right there on the editor’s desk. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Yes, it was a job of nuance and erudition, Shalamov said. A paragon of scholarship. But there was one small matter that needed to be addressed before printing. It was an elision in the letter of the sixth of June 1904. </p>

<p class="calibre1">“Let’s see to it,” said Mishka. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Here,” said Shalamov, rotating the galley so that Mishka could review the letter for himself. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">Berlin, </i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">June 6, 1904</i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">Dear Masha, </i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">I am writing you from Berlin. I’ve been here a whole day now. It</i> <i class="calibre3">turned very cold in Moscow and even snowed after you left; the bad</i> <i class="calibre3">weather must have given me a cold, I began having rheumatic pains</i> <i class="calibre3">in my arms and legs, I couldn’t sleep at night, lost a great deal of</i> <i class="calibre3">weight, had morphine injections, took thousands of different kinds of</i> <i class="calibre3">medicine, and recall with gratitude only the heroin Altschuller once</i> <i class="calibre3">prescribed for me. Nonetheless, toward departure time I began to</i></p>

<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">Yours, </i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">A. Chekhov</i></p>
<p class="calibre1">Mishka read the passage once, then read it again while calling up in his mind’s eye an image of the original letter. After four years, he knew most of them by heart. But as hard as he tried, he could not identify the discrepancy. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What is missing?” he asked, at last. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh,” said Shalamov, in the tone of one who suddenly understands a simple misapprehension between friends. “It is not that something is missing. It is that something must be taken out. Here.” </p>

<p class="calibre1">“This part should be taken out?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes. That’s right.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“As in stricken.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“If you wish.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“And why, might I ask?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“In the interests of concision.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p262"></a>“So it is to save paper! And once I have taken out this little passage of the sixth of June, where shall you have me put it? In the bank? In a dresser drawer? In Lenin’s tomb?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">As Mishka had been relating this exchange to the Count, his voice had grown increasingly loud, as if with a renewed sense of outrage; but then he suddenly fell silent. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“And then Shalamov,” he continued after a moment, “this Shalamov from our youth, he tells me that I can shoot the passage from a cannon for all he cares, but it must be taken out. So do you know what I did, Sasha? </p>
<p class="calibre1">Can you even imagine?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">One might well draw the conclusion, that a man prone to pacing is a man who will act judiciously—given the unusual amount of time he has allocated to the consideration of causes and consequences, of ramifications and repercussions. But it had been the Count’s experience that men prone to pace are always on the verge of acting impulsively. For while the men who pace are being whipped along by logic, it is a multifaceted sort of logic, which brings them no closer to a clear understanding, or even a state of conviction. Rather, it leaves them at such a loss that they end up exposed to the influence of the merest whim, to the seduction of the rash or reckless act</p>
<p class="calibre1">—almost as if they had never considered the matter at all. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No, Mishka,” the Count admitted with some sense of foreboding. “I can’t imagine. What did you do?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mishka ran a hand across his forehead. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What is a man supposed to do when confronted with such madness? I struck the passage out. Then I walked from the room without a word.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Upon hearing this denouement, the Count felt a great sense of relief. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Were it not for the defeated appearance of his old friend, he might even have smiled. For one must admit, there was something genuinely comic about the circumstances. It could have been a tale from Gogol with Shalamov playing the part of a well-fed privy councillor impressed by his own rank. And the offending passage, hearing of its pending fate, could have climbed out a window and escaped down an alley never to be heard from again—that is, until it reappeared ten years later on the arm of a French countess, wearing a pince-nez and the  <i class="calibre3">Légion d’honneur</i>. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But the Count maintained a solemn expression. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p263"></a><img class="calibre2" src="index-263_1.jpg"/></p>
<p class="calibre1">“You were perfectly right,” he consoled. “It was just a matter of a few sentences. Fifty words out of a few hundred thousand.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The Count pointed out that on the balance, Mikhail had so much to be proud of. An authoritative collection of Chekhov’s letters was long overdue. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It promised to inspire a whole new generation of scholars and students, readers and writers. And Shalamov? With his long nose and little eyes, the Count had always found him to be something of a ferret, and one mustn’t let a ferret spoil one’s sense of accomplishment, or one’s cause for celebration. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Listen, my friend,” the Count concluded with a smile, “you arrived on the overnight train and missed your lunch. That’s half the problem right there. Go back to your hotel. Take a bath. Have something to eat and a glass of wine. Get a good night’s sleep. Then tomorrow night, we shall meet at the Shalyapin as planned, raise a glass to brother Anton, and have a good laugh at the ferret’s expense.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">In this manner, the Count attempted to comfort his old friend, buoy his spirits, and move him gently toward the door. </p>
<p class="calibre1">At 11:40, the Count finally descended to the ground floor and knocked at Marina’s. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’m so sorry I’m late,” he said in a whisper when the seamstress answered the door. “Where is Sofia? I can carry her upstairs.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“There’s no need to whisper, Alexander. She’s awake.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You kept her up!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I didn’t keep anybody anything,” Marina retorted. “She insisted upon waiting for you.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The two went inside, where Sofia was sitting on a chair with perfect posture. At the sight of the Count, she leapt to the floor, walked to his side, and took him by the hand. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Marina raised an eyebrow, as if to say:  <i class="calibre3">You see . . . </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">The Count raised his own eyebrows, as if to reply:  <i class="calibre3">Imagine that</i> . . . </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Thank you for dinner, Aunt Marina,” Sofia said to the seamstress. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Thank you for coming, Sofia.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Then Sofia looked up at the Count. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p264"></a><img class="calibre2" src="index-264_1.jpg"/></p>
<p class="calibre1">“Can we go now?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Certainly, my dear.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">When they left Marina’s, it was obvious enough to the Count that little Sofia was ready for bed. Without letting go of his hand, she led him straight to the lobby, onto the elevator, and pressed the button for the fifth floor with the command of  <i class="calibre3">Presto</i>. When they reached the belfry, rather than asking to be carried, she practically dragged him up the last flight of stairs. And when he introduced her to the ingenious design of their new bunk bed, she barely took notice. Instead, she hurried down the hall to brush her teeth and get into her nightgown. </p>

<p class="calibre1">“Aren’t you ready for bed?” the Count asked in surprise. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Wait,” she replied, putting up a hand to silence him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Then she leaned a little to her right in order to look around his torso. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mystified, the Count stepped aside and turned—just in time to see the long-strided watchman of the minutes catch up with his bowlegged brother of the hours. As the two embraced, the springs loosened, the wheels spun, and the miniature hammer of the twice-tolling clock began to signal the arrival of midnight. As Sofia listened, she sat perfectly still. Then, with the twelfth and final chime, she leapt down from the chair and climbed into bed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Goodnight, Uncle Alexander,” she said; and before the Count could tuck her in, she had fallen fast asleep. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It had been a long day for the Count, one of the longest in memory. On the verge of exhaustion, he brushed his teeth and donned his pajamas almost as quickly as Sofia had. Then, returning to their bedroom, he put out the light and eased himself onto the mattress under Sofia’s bedsprings. True, the Count had no bedsprings of his own, and the stacked tomato cans barely suspended Sofia’s bed high enough for him to turn on his side; but it was a decided improvement upon the hardwood floor. So, having lived a day that his father would have been proud of, and hearing Sofia’s delicate respirations, the Count closed his eyes and prepared to drift into a dreamless sleep. But, alas, sleep did not come so easily to our weary friend. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p265"></a><img class="calibre2" src="index-265_1.jpg"/></p>
<p class="calibre1">Like in a reel in which the dancers form two rows, so that one of their number can come skipping brightly down the aisle, a concern of the Count’s would present itself for his consideration, bow with a flourish, and then take its place at the end of the line so that the next concern could come dancing to the fore. </p>
<p class="calibre1">What exactly were the Count’s concerns? </p>

<p class="calibre1">He was worried about Nina and her journey east. The Count had not heard much about Sevvostlag, but he had heard enough about Siberia to comprehend the inhospitability of the road that Nina had chosen for herself. . . . </p>
<p class="calibre1">He was worried about little Sofia—and not simply over the cutting of her meat and the changing of her clothes. Whether dining in the Piazza or riding the elevator to the fifth floor, a little girl in the Metropol would not go unnoticed for long. Though Sofia was only staying with the Count for a matter of weeks, there was always the possibility that, before Nina’s return, some bureaucrat would become aware of her residency and forbid it. . . . </p>
<p class="calibre1">And finally, in the interests of being utterly forthright, it should be added that the Count was worried about the following morning—when, having nibbled her biscuit and stolen his strawberries, Sofia would once again climb into his chair and look back at him with her dark blue eyes. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Perhaps it is inescapable that when our lives are in flux, despite the comfort of our beds, we are bound to keep ourselves awake grappling with anxieties</p>
<p class="calibre1">—no matter how great or small, how real or imagined. But in point of fact, Count Rostov had good reason to be concerned about his old friend Mishka. </p>
<p class="calibre1">When he left the Metropol late on the night of the twenty-first of June, Mikhail Mindich followed the Count’s advice to the letter. He went straight to his hotel, bathed, ate, and tucked himself in for a good night’s sleep. And</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p266"></a>when he awoke, he looked upon the events of the previous day with more perspective. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In the light of morning, he saw that the Count was perfectly right—that it was only a matter of fifty words. And it was not as if Shalamov had asked him to cut the last lines of  <i class="calibre3">The Cherry Orchard</i> or  <i class="calibre3">The Seagull</i>. It was a passage that might have appeared in the correspondence of any traveler in Europe and that Chekhov himself had, in all probability, composed without a second thought. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But after dressing and eating a late breakfast, when Mishka headed to the Central House of Writers, he happened to pass that statue of Gorky on Arbatskaya Square, where the brooding statue of Gogol once had stood. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Other than Mayakovsky, Maxim Gorky had been Mishka’s greatest contemporary hero. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Here was a man,” said Mishka to himself (as he stood in the middle of the sidewalk ignoring the passersby), “who once wrote with such fresh and unsentimental directness that his memories of youth became <i class="calibre3"> our </i> memories of youth.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">But having settled in Italy, he was lured back to Russia by Stalin in ’34</p>
<p class="calibre1">and set up in Ryabushinsky’s mansion—so that he could preside over the establishment of Socialist Realism as the sole artistic style of the entire Russian people. . . . </p>
<p class="calibre1">“And what has been the fallout of that?” Mishka demanded of the statue. </p>
<p class="calibre1">All but ruined, Bulgakov hadn’t written a word in years. Akhmatova had put down her pen. Mandelstam, having already served his sentence, had apparently been arrested again. And Mayakovsky? Oh, Mayakovsky . . . </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mishka pulled at the hairs of his beard. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Back in ’22, how boldly he had predicted to Sasha that these four would come together to forge a new poetry for Russia. Improbably, perhaps. But in the end, that is exactly what they had done. They had created the poetry of silence. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes, silence can be an opinion,” said Mishka. “Silence can be a form of protest. It can be a means of survival. But it can also be a school of poetry</p>
<p class="calibre1">—one with its own meter, tropes, and conventions. One that needn’t be written with pencils or pens; but that can be written in the soul with a revolver to the chest.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p267"></a>With that, Mishka turned his back on Maxim Gorky and the Central House of Writers, and he went instead to the offices of  <i class="calibre3">Goslitizdat</i>. There, he mounted the stairs, brushed past the receptionist, and opened door after door until he found the ferret in a conference room, presiding over an editorial meeting. In the center of the table were platters of cheese and figs and cured herring, the very sight of which, for some unaccountable reason, filled Mishka with fury. Turning from Shalamov in order to see who had barged through the door were the junior editors and assistant editors, all young and earnest—a fact that only infuriated Mishka more. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Very good!” he shouted. “I see you have your knives out. What will you be cutting in half today?  <i class="calibre3">The</i> <i class="calibre3">Brothers Karamozov</i>?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Mikhail Fyodorovich,” said Shalamov in shock. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What is  <i class="calibre3">this</i>!” Mishka proclaimed, pointing to a young woman who happened to have a slice of bread topped with herring in her hand. “Is that bread from Berlin? Be careful, comrade. If you take a single bite, Shalamov will shoot you from a cannon.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mishka could see that the young girl thought he was mad; but she put the piece of bread back on the table nonetheless. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Aha!” Mishka exclaimed in vindication. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Shalamov rose from his chair, both unnerved and concerned. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Mikhail,” he said. “You are clearly upset. I would be happy to speak with you later in my office about whatever is on your mind. But as you can see, we are in the midst of a meeting. And we still have hours of business to attend to. . . .” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Hours of business. Of that I have no doubt.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mishka began ticking off the rest of the day’s business, and with each item he picked up a manuscript from in front of one of the staff members and flung it across the room in Shalamov’s direction. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“There are statues to be moved! Lines to be elided! And at five o’clock, you mustn’t be late for your bath with comrade Stalin. For if you are, who will be there to scrub his back?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“He’s raving,” said a young man with glasses. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Mikhail,” Shalamov pleaded. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The future of Russian poetry is the haiku!” Mishka shouted in conclusion, then, with great satisfaction, he slammed the door on his way</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p268"></a><img class="calibre2" src="index-268_1.jpg"/></p>
<p class="calibre1"><img class="calibre2" src="index-268_2.jpg"/></p>
<p class="calibre1">out. In fact, so satisfying was this gesture that he slammed every door that stood between him and the street below. </p>
<p class="calibre1">And what, to borrow a phrase, was the fallout of that? </p>
<p class="calibre1">Within a day, the gist of Mishka’s comments were shared with the authorities; within a week, they were set down word for word. In August, he was invited to the offices of the NKVD in Leningrad for questioning. In November, he was brought before one of the extrajudicial troikas of the era. </p>
<p class="calibre1">And in March 1939, he was on a train bound for Siberia and the realm of second thoughts. </p>

<p class="calibre1">The Count was also right to worry that Sofia’s residency would be noted. </p>
<p class="calibre1">For not only was her presence remarked, within a fortnight of her arrival a letter was sent to an administrative office within the Kremlin stating that a Former Person living under house arrest on the top floor of the Metropol Hotel was caring for a five-year-old child of unknown parentage. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Upon its receipt, this letter was carefully read, stamped, and forwarded to a higher office—where it was counterstamped and directed up another two floors. There, it reached the sort of desk where with the swipe of a pen, matrons from the state orphanage could be dispersed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It just so happened, however, that a cursory examination of this Former Person’s recent associates led to a certain willowy actress—who for years had been the reputed paramour of a round-faced Commisar recently appointed to the Politburo. Within the walls of a small, drab office in an especially bureaucratic branch of government, it is generally difficult to accurately imagine the world outside. But it is never hard to imagine what</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p269"></a><img class="calibre2" src="index-269_1.jpg"/></p>
<p class="calibre1"><img class="calibre2" src="index-269_2.jpg"/></p>
<p class="calibre1">might occur to one’s career were one to seize the illegitimate daughter of a Politburo member and place her in a home. Such initiative would be rewarded with a blindfold and a cigarette. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As a result, only the most discreet inquiries were made. Indications were obtained that this actress had in all likelihood been in a relationship with the Politburo member for at least six years. In addition, an employee of the hotel confirmed that on the very day the young girl arrived at the hotel, the actress was also in residence. As such, all of the information that had been gathered in the course of the investigation was placed in a drawer under lock and key (on the off chance it might prove useful one day). While the pernicious little letter that had launched the inquiry in the first place was set on fire and dropped in the waste bin where it belonged. </p>
<p class="calibre1">So yes, the Count had every reason to be concerned about Mishka, Nina, and Sofia. But did he have cause to be anxious about the following morning? </p>
<p class="calibre1">As it turned out, once they had made their beds and nibbled their biscuits, Sofia did climb up into the desk chair; but rather than stare at the Count expectantly, she unfurled a litany of additional questions about Idlehour and his family, as if she had been composing them in her sleep. </p>
<p class="calibre1">And in the days that followed, a man who had long prided himself on his ability to tell a story in the most succinct manner with an emphasis on the most salient points, by necessity became a master of the digression, the parenthetical remark, the footnote, eventually even learning to anticipate Sofia’s relentless inquiries before she had the time to phrase them. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Popular wisdom tells us that when the reel of our concerns interferes with our ability to fall asleep, the best remedy is the counting of sheep in a meadow. But preferring to have his lamb encrusted with herbs and served with a red wine reduction, the Count chose a different methodology altogether. As he listened to Sofia breathing, he went back to the moment that he woke on the hardwood floor, and by systematically reconstructing his various visits to the lobby, the Piazza, the Boyarsky, Anna’s suite, the</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p270"></a>basement, and Marina’s office, he carefully calculated how many flights of stairs he had climbed or descended over the course of the day. Up and down he went in his mind, counting one flight after another, until with the final ascent to the twice-tolling clock he reached a grand total of fifty-nine—at which point he slipped into a well-deserved sleep. </p>

<p class="calibre1">“Ah, yes . . .” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p272"></a><b class="calibre4">1946</b></p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre4">O</b>n Saturday, the twenty-first of June 1946, as the sun rose high over the Kremlin, a lone figure climbed slowly up the steps from the Moskva River embankment, continued past St. Basil’s Cathedral, and made his way onto Red Square. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dressed in a ragged winter coat, he swung his right leg in a small semicircle as he walked. At another time, the combination of the ragged coat and hobbled leg might have made the man stand out on such a bright summer day. But in 1946, there were men limping about in borrowed clothes in every quarter of the capital. For that matter, they were limping about in every city of Europe. </p>
<p class="calibre1">That afternoon, the square was as crowded as if it were a market day. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Women in floral dresses lingered under the arcades of the old State Department Store. Before the gates of the Kremlin, schoolboys climbed on two decommissioned tanks as soldiers in white fitted jackets standing at regular intervals watched with their hands clasped loosely behind their backs. And from the entrance of Lenin’s tomb snaked a line 150 citizens long. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The man in the ragged coat paused for a moment to admire the orderly behavior of his far-flung countrymen waiting in the queue. At the front stood eight Uzbeks with drooping moustaches dressed in their best silk coats; then came four girls from the east with long braids and brightly embroidered caps; then ten muzhiks from Georgia, and so on, and so on—</p>
<p class="calibre1">one constituency waiting patiently behind the next to pay their respects to the remains of a man who died over twenty years before. </p>
<p class="calibre1">If we have learned nothing else, the lone figure reflected with a crooked smile, at least we have learned to stand in line. </p>
<p class="calibre1">To a foreigner, it must have seemed that Russia had become the land of ten thousand lines. For there were lines at the tram stops, lines before the grocer, lines at the agencies of labor, education, and housing. But in point of</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p273"></a><img class="calibre2" src="index-273_1.jpg"/></p>
<p class="calibre1">fact, there were not ten thousand lines, or even ten. There was one all-encompassing line, which wound across the country and back through time. </p>
<p class="calibre1">This had been Lenin’s greatest innovation: a line that, like the Proletariat itself, was universal and infinite. He established it by decree in 1917 and personally took the first slot as his comrades jostled to line up behind him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">One by one every Russian took his place, and the line grew longer and longer until it shared all of the attributes of life. In it friendships were formed and romances kindled; patience was fostered; civility practiced; even wisdom attained. </p>
<p class="calibre1">If one is willing to stand in line for eight hours to purchase a loaf of bread, the lone figure thought, what is an hour or two to see the corpse of a hero free of charge? </p>
<p class="calibre1">Passing the spot where Kazan Cathedral had once seen fit to stand, he turned right and walked on; but as he entered Theatre Square he came to a stop. For as his gaze moved from the Palace of Unions, to the Bolshoi, to the Maly Theatre, and finally to the Metropol Hotel, he had to marvel to find so many of the old facades unspoiled. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Five years before to the day, the Germans had launched Operation Barbarossa—the offensive in which more than three million soldiers deployed from Odessa to the Baltic crossed the Russian frontier. </p>
<p class="calibre1">When the operation commenced, Hitler estimated the Wehrmacht would secure Moscow within four months. In fact, having captured Minsk, Kiev, and Smolensk, by late October the German forces had already advanced nearly six hundred miles and were approaching Moscow from the north and south in a classic pincer formation. Within a matter of days, the city would be in range of their artillery. </p>
<p class="calibre1">By this time, a measure of lawlessness had broken out in the capital. The streets were crowded with refugees and deserters who were sleeping in makeshift encampments and cooking looted food over open fires. With the relocation of the seat of government to Kuybyshev underway, the sixteen bridges of the city were mined so that they could be demolished on a moment’s notice. Columns of smoke rose above the Kremlin walls from the bonfires of classified files, while in the streets municipal and factory</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p274"></a>workers, who had not been paid in months, watched with seasoned foreboding as the eternally lit windows of the old fortress began to go dark one by one. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But on the afternoon of the thirtieth of October, an observer—standing in the very spot where our ragged itinerant now stood—would have witnessed a bewildering sight. A small cadre of laborers under the direction of the secret police were carrying chairs out of the Bolshoi on their way to the Mayakovsky Metro Station. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Later that night, the full membership of the Politburo assembled on the platform, one hundred feet below the surface of the city. Safe from the reach of German artillery, they took their seats at nine o’clock at a long table lined with food and wine. Shortly thereafter, a single train pulled into the station, its doors opened, and out stepped Stalin in full military dress. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Assuming his rightful position at the head of the table, Marshal Soso said that his purpose in convening the Party leadership was twofold. First, it was to declare that while those assembled were welcome to make their way to Kuybyshev, he, for one, had no intention of going anywhere. He would remain in Moscow until the last drop of Russian blood had been spilled. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Second, he announced that on the seventh of November the annual commemoration of the Revolution would be celebrated on Red Square as usual. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Many Muscovites would come to remember that parade as something of a turning point. To hear the heart-swelling sound of “The Internationale” to the accompaniment of fifty thousand boots while their leader stood defiant on the rostrum bolstered their confidence and hardened their resolve. On that day, they would recall, the tide decidedly turned. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Others, however, would point to the seven hundred thousand soldiers whom Soso had held in reserve in the Far East and who, even as the celebration was taking place, were being spirited across the country to Moscow’s aid. Still others would note that it snowed on twenty-eight of the thirty-one days that December, effectively grounding the Luftwaffe. It certainly didn’t hurt that the average temperature fell to minus 20˚—a climate as alien to the Wehrmacht as it had been to the forces of Napoleon. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Whatever the cause, although it took Hitler’s troops just five months to march from the Russian frontier to the outskirts of Moscow, they would never pass through the city’s gates. Having taken over one million prisoners</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p275"></a><img class="calibre2" src="index-275_1.jpg"/></p>
<p class="calibre1">and one million lives, they would begin their retreat in January 1942, leaving the city surprisingly intact. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Stepping from the curb, our lone figure gave way to a young officer driving a motorcycle with a girl in a bright orange dress in his sidecar; he passed between the two captured German fighter planes on display in the defoliated square; then skirting the Metropol’s main entrance, he wound around the corner and disappeared down the alley at the back of the hotel. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p276"></a> <i class="calibre3"><b class="calibre4">Antics, Antitheses, an Accident</b></i></p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre4">A</b>t 1:30, in the manager’s office of the Metropol Hotel, Count Alexander Ilyich Rostov took the chair across the desk from the man with the narrow head and superior demeanor. </p>
<p class="calibre1">When the Count had received the Bishop’s summons in the Piazza, he had assumed the matter must be urgent because the messenger had waited for him to finish his demitasse and then led him promptly to the executive suite. But once the Count had been ushered through the manager’s door, the Bishop barely glanced up from the papers he was signing. Rather, he waved his pen toward the empty chair in the manner of one who wishes to indicate that he will be with you in a moment. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Thank you,” said the Count, accepting this perfunctory offer of a chair with a perfunctory bow of the head. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Not one to sit idly about, the Count made use of the empty minutes by surveying the office, which had undergone something of a transformation since Jozef Halecki had occupied it. While the desk of the former manager remained, it was no longer impressively bare. Along with six piles of paper, it now boasted a stapler, a penholder, and  <i class="calibre3">two</i> telephones (presumably so the Bishop could put the Central Committee on hold while he dialed up the Politburo). In place of the burgundy chaise where the old Pole had allegedly reclined, there were now three gray filing cabinets with stainless-steel locks standing at attention. And the delightful hunting scenes that had once adorned the mahogany panels had been replaced, of course, with portraits of Messrs. Stalin, Lenin, and Marx. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Having inscribed his signature on twelve sheets of paper to his perfect satisfaction, the Bishop established a seventh pile at the edge of his desk, replaced the pen in its stand, and for the first time looked the Count in the eye. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I gather you are an early riser, Alexander Ilyich,” he said after a moment of silence. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p277"></a><img class="calibre2" src="index-277_1.jpg"/></p>
<p class="calibre1">“Men of purpose usually are.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The corner of the Bishop’s mouth rose ever so slightly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes, of course. Men of purpose.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He reached across his desk to straighten his newest pile of papers. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“And you breakfast in your room at around seven . . . ?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That’s right.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Then at eight, it is your habit to read the papers in the lobby.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">Confound the fellow</i>, thought the Count. He interrupts the conclusion of a perfectly delightful lunch with a hand-delivered summons. Clearly, there is something on his mind. But must it always be on the bias with him? Has he no facility with the direct question? No appreciation for it? Were they to sit there reviewing the Count’s typical day minute by minute—when the Triumvirate was scheduled to meet in less than an hour? </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes,” confirmed the Count a little impatiently. “I read the morning papers in the morning.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But in the lobby. You come down to the lobby.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Without fail, I walk down the stairs to read in the comfort of the lobby.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The Bishop sat back in his chair and offered the briefest of smiles. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Then perhaps you are aware of the incident that occurred this morning in the fourth-floor corridor at a quarter to eight. . . .” </p>
<p class="calibre1">For the record, the Count had risen shortly after seven. Having completed fifteen squats and fifteen stretches, having enjoyed his coffee, biscuit, and a piece of fruit (today a tangerine), having bathed, shaved, and dressed, he kissed Sofia on the forehead and departed from their bedroom with the intention of reading the papers in his favorite lobby chair. Descending one flight, he exited the belfry and traversed the hall to the main stair, as was his habit. But as he turned on the fifth-floor landing, he heard sounds of commotion coming from below. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The immediate impression was of fifteen voices shouting in twenty languages. These were accompanied by the slamming of a door, the shattering of a plate, and a rather insistent squawking that seemed distinctly</p>

<p class="calibre1">Nearly every door was open and every guest in the hall. Among those assembled were two French journalists, a Swiss diplomat, three Uzbek fur traders, a representative of the Roman Catholic Church, and a repatriated opera tenor with his family of five. Still in their pajamas, most of the members of this convention were waving their arms and expressing themselves emphatically—as three adult geese scurried between their legs, honking and beating their wings. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Several of the women were acting as terrorized as if they had been descended upon by Harpies. The wife of the tenor was cowering behind her husband’s prodigious torso, and Kristina, one of the hotel’s chambermaids, was backed against a wall, clutching an empty tray to her chest while at her feet lay a confusion of cutlery and kasha. </p>
<p class="calibre1">When the tenor’s three sons displayed their fortitude by giving chase to the three different birds in three different directions, the ambassador from the Vatican advised the tenor on the proper behavior of children. The tenor, who spoke only a few words of Italian, informed the prelate ( <i class="calibre3">fortissimo</i>) that he was not a man to be toyed with. The Swiss diplomat, who spoke both Russian and Italian fluently, exemplified his nation’s reputation for neutrality by listening to both men with his mouth shut. When the prelate stepped forward to make his point more pontifically, one of the geese, which had been cornered by the tenor’s eldest son, shot through his legs into his apartment—at which point, a young woman, who was decidedly not a representative of the Roman Catholic Church, came racing into the hallway wrapped only in a blue kimono. </p>
<p class="calibre1">By this point, the commotion had apparently awakened the guests on the fifth floor, as several came tromping down the stairs to see what all the fuss was about. At the forefront of this contingent was the American general—a no-nonsense figure who hailed from what is reportedly known as “The Great State of Texas.” Having quickly assessed the situation, the general grabbed one of the geese by the throat. The speed with which he captured the bird gave those assembled a boost of confidence. Several even cheered him on. That is, until he wrapped his second hand around the goose’s neck with the clear intention of snapping it. This elicited a scream from the young woman in the blue kimono, tears from the tenor’s daughter, and a</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p279"></a><img class="calibre2" src="index-279_1.jpg"/></p>
<p class="calibre1">stern reproach from the Swiss diplomat. Stymied at the very instant of decisive action, the general expressed his exasperation with the fecklessness of civilians, walked into the prelate’s apartment, and tossed the goose out the window. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Committed to restoring order, the general returned a moment later and deftly seized a second goose. But when he held up this bird to assure the assembly of his peaceful intent, the tie at his waist unraveled and his robe flew open, revealing a seasoned pair of olive green briefs, prompting the wife of the tenor to faint. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As the Count watched these proceedings from the landing, he became aware of a presence at his side. Turning, he found it was the general’s aide-de-camp, a gregarious fellow who had become something of a fixture in the Shalyapin. Taking in the scene at a glance, the aide-de-camp issued a sigh of satisfaction and then remarked to no one in particular:</p>
<p class="calibre1">“How I love this hotel.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">So, was the Count “aware” of what took place in the fourth-floor corridor at a quarter to eight? One might just as well ask if Noah was aware of the Flood, or Adam the Apple. Of course he was aware. No man on earth was <i class="calibre3">more</i> aware. But what aspect of his awareness could possibly warrant the interruption of a demitasse? </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I am familiar with this morning’s events,” confirmed the Count, “as I happened to be rounding the landing at the very moment they occurred.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“So you witnessed the mayhem <i class="calibre3"> in</i> <i class="calibre3">person . . . ? </i>” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes. I saw the antics unfolding firsthand. Even so, I am not entirely certain as to why I am here.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You are in the dark, as it were.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“In point of fact, I am flummoxed. Mystified.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Of course.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Following a moment of silence, the Bishop offered his most ecclesiastical smile. Then, as if it were perfectly normal to wander about an office in the middle of a conversation, he rose and crossed to the wall, where he gingerly straightened the portrait of Mr. Marx, who, having</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p280"></a><img class="calibre2" src="index-280_1.jpg"/></p>
<p class="calibre1">slipped on his hook, was admittedly undermining the ideological authority of the room. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Turning back, the Bishop continued. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I can see why in describing these unfortunate events you chose to discard  <i class="calibre3">mayhem</i> in favor of  <i class="calibre3">antics</i>. For  <i class="calibre3">antics</i> do seem to suggest a certain childishness . . .” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The Count considered this for a moment. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You don’t suspect the tenor’s boys?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Hardly. After all, the geese had been locked in a cage in the pantry of the Boyarsky.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Are you suggesting that Emile had something to do with it?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The Bishop ignored the Count’s question and resumed his place behind the desk. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The Metropol Hotel,” he informed the Count unnecessarily, “is host to some of the world’s most eminent statesmen and prominent artistes. When they pass through our doors, they have the right to expect unparalleled comfort, unsurpassed service, and mornings free of mayhem. Needless to say,” he concluded, reaching for his pen, “I shall get to the bottom of this.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well,” replied the Count, rising from his chair, “if getting to the bottom is what is called for, I am sure there is no man better suited for the job.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">A certain childishness</i>, muttered the Count as he exited the executive suite. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">Mornings of mayhem . . . </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">Did the Bishop think him a fool? Did he imagine for one second that the Count couldn’t see what he was angling at? What he was insinuating? That little Sofia was somehow involved? </p>
<p class="calibre1">Not only could the Count tell  <i class="calibre3">exactly</i> what the Bishop was driving at, he could have countered with a few insinuations of his own—and in iambic pentameter, no less. But the notion of Sofia’s involvement was so unfounded, so preposterous, so outrageous, it did not  <i class="calibre3">deserve</i> a response. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Now, the Count could not deny that Sofia had a certain playful streak, just as any child of thirteen should. But she was no gadabout. No gadfly. No ne’er-do-well. In fact, as the Count was returning from the manager’s office, there she was sitting in the lobby bent over some weighty textbook. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p281"></a>It was a tableau familiar to any member of the Metropol staff. For hours on end she sat in that very chair memorizing capitals, conjugating verbs, and solving for  <i class="calibre3">x</i> or  <i class="calibre3">y</i>. With an equal sense of dedication she studied her sewing with Marina and her sauces with Emile. Why, ask anyone who knew Sofia to describe her and they would tell you that she was studious, shy, and well behaved; or in a word,  <i class="calibre3">demure</i>. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As he mounted the stairs to the upper floors, the Count enumerated the relevant facts like a jurist: In eight years, Sofia had not thrown a single tantrum; every day she had brushed her teeth and headed off to school without a fuss; and whether it was time to bundle up, buckle down, or eat her peas, she had done so without complaint. Even that little game of her own invention, which she had grown so fond of playing, was founded on a quality of poise that was beyond her years. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Here is how it was played:</p>

<p class="calibre1">Naturally, this resulted in the calling of the Lord’s name in vain and the dropping of whatever happened to be in one’s hand (three books and a glass of wine so far this year). </p>
<p class="calibre1">Setting aside the fact that such a game could prove fatal to a man approaching his sixties, one had to marvel at the young lady’s expertise. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Not a patter of the heart, not a panting of the breath, not a drop of perspiration on her brow. Nor would she emit a giggle or exhibit the slightest smirk. On the contrary. With an expression that was studious, shy, </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p282"></a>and well behaved, she would acknowledge the Count with a friendly nod, and looking back at her book, turn the page, demurely. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The notion that a child so composed would conspire to the releasing of geese was simply preposterous. One might as well accuse her of toppling the Tower of Babel or knocking the nose off the Sphinx. </p>
<p class="calibre1">True, she had been in the kitchen eating her supper when the chef du cuisine first received word that a certain Swiss diplomat, who had ordered the roast goose, had questioned the freshness of the poultry. And admittedly, she was devoted to her Uncle Emile. Even so, how was a thirteen-year-old girl to spirit three adult fowl to the fourth floor of an international hotel at seven in the morning without detection? The very idea, concluded the Count as he opened the door to his rooms, confounded one’s reason, offended the laws of nature, and flew in the face of common—</p>
<p class="calibre1">“<i class="calibre3">Iesu Christi!” </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">Sofia, who the moment before had been in the lobby, was seated at the Grand Duke’s desk, leaning diligently over her tome. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh, hello, Papa,” she said without looking up. </p>
<p class="calibre1">. . . </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Apparently, it is no longer considered polite to look up from one’s work when a gentleman enters a room.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Sofia turned in her chair. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’m sorry, Papa. I was immersed in my reading.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Hmm. And what might that be?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It is an essay on cannibalism.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“An essay on cannibalism!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“By Michel de Montaigne.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Ah. Yes. Well. That’s time well spent, I’m sure,” conceded the Count. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But as he headed toward the study, he thought,  <i class="calibre3">Michel de</i> <i class="calibre3">Montaigne</i> . . . ? Then he shot a glance at the base of their bureau. </p>
<p class="calibre1">. . . </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Is that  <i class="calibre3">Anna Karenina</i>?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Sofia followed his gaze. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes, I believe it is.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But what is she doing down there?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“She was the closest in thickness to Montaigne.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The closest in thickness!” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p283"></a><img class="calibre2" src="index-283_1.jpg"/></p>
<p class="calibre1">“Is something wrong?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">. . . </p>
<p class="calibre1">“All I can say is that Anna Karenina would never have put  <i class="calibre3">you</i> under a bureau just because you happened to be as thick as Montaigne.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The very idea is preposterous,” the Count was saying. “How is a thirteen-year-old girl to spirit three fully grown geese up two flights of stairs without the slightest detection? Besides, I ask you: Is such behavior even in her character?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Certainly not,” said Emile. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No, not in the least,” agreed Andrey. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The three men shook their heads in shared indignation. </p>
<p class="calibre1">One of the advantages of working together for many years is that the daily rigmarole can be dispensed with quickly, leaving ample time for discussions of weightier concerns—such as rheumatism, the inadequacy of public transit, and the petty behavior of the inexplicably promoted. After two decades, the members of the Triumvirate knew a thing or two about the small-minded men who sat behind stacks of paper, and the so-called gourmands from Geneva who couldn’t tell a goose from a grouse. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It’s outrageous,” said the Count. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Unquestionably.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“And to summon me half an hour before our daily meeting, at which there is never a shortage of important matters to discuss.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Quite so,” agreed Andrey. “Which reminds me, Alexander . . .” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Before we open tonight, could you have someone sweep out the dumbwaiter?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Certainly. Is it a mess?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’m afraid so. It has somehow become littered with feathers. . . .” </p>
<p class="calibre1">In saying this, Andrey used one of his legendary fingers to scratch his upper lip while Emile pretended to sip at his tea <i class="calibre3">. </i> And the Count? He opened his mouth with every intention of making the perfect rejoinder—the sort of remark that having cut one man to the quick would be quoted by others for years to come. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p284"></a>But there was a knock at the door, and young Ilya entered with his wooden spoon. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Over the course of the Great Patriotic War, Emile had lost the seasoned members of his crew one by one, even the whistling Stanislav. With every able-bodied man eventually in the army, he had been forced to staff his kitchen with adolescents. Thus, Ilya, who had been hired in 1943, had been promoted on the basis of seniority to sous-chef in 1945, at the ripe old age of nineteen. As a reflection of qualified confidence, Emile had bestowed upon him a spoon in place of a knife. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well?” said Emile, looking up with impatience. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In response, Ilya hesitated. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Emile looked to the other members of the Triumvirate and rolled his eyes, as much as to say:  <i class="calibre3">You see what I must put up with? </i> Then he turned back to his apprentice. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“As anyone can see, we are men with business to attend to. But apparently, you have something of such importance that you feel the need to interrupt. Well then, out with it—before we expire from anticipation.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The young man opened his mouth, but then rather than explain himself, he simply pointed his spoon toward the kitchen. Following the direction of the utensil, the members of the Triumvirate looked through the office window and there, near the door to the back stair, stood an unfortunate-looking soul in a ragged winter coat. At the sight of him, Emile grew crimson. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Who let him in here?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I did, sir.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Emile stood so abruptly he nearly knocked over his chair. Then, just as a commander will tear the epaulettes from the shoulders of an errant officer, Emile grabbed the spoon from Ilya’s hand. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“So, you’re the Commissar of Nincompoops now, is that it? Eh? When I had my back turned, you were promoted to the General Secretary of Bunglers?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The young man took a step back. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No, sir. I have not been promoted.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Emile smacked the table with the spoon, nearly cracking it in two. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Of course you haven’t! How often have I told you not to let beggars in the kitchen? Don’t you see that if you give him a crust of bread today, there</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p285"></a><img class="calibre2" src="index-285_1.jpg"/></p>
<p class="calibre1">will be five of his friends here tomorrow, and fifty the day after that?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes, sir, but . . . but . . .” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But but but what?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“He didn’t ask for food.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Eh?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The young man pointed to the Count. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“He asked for Alexander Ilyich.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Andrey and Emile both looked to their colleague in surprise. The Count in turn looked through the window at the beggar. Then without saying a word, he rose from his chair, exited the office, and embraced this boon companion whom he had not seen in eight long years. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Though Andrey and Emile had never met the stranger, as soon as they heard his name they knew exactly who he was: the one who had lived with the Count above the cobbler’s shop; the one who had paced a thousand miles in increments of fifteen feet; the lover of Mayakovsky and Mandelstam who, like so many others, had been tried and sentenced in the name of Article 58. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Why don’t you make yourselves comfortable,” suggested Andrey with a gesture of his hand. “You can use Emile’s office.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes,” agreed Emile. “By all means. My office.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">With his impeccable instincts, Andrey led Mishka to the chair with its back to the kitchen while Emile placed bread and salt on the table—that ancient Russian symbol of hospitality. A moment later he returned with a plate of potatoes and cutlets of veal. Then the chef and maître d’ excused themselves, closing the door so that the two old friends could speak undisturbed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mishka looked at the table. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Bread and salt,” he said with a smile. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As the Count looked across at Mishka, he was moved by two contrary currents of emotion. On the one hand, there was that special joy of seeing a friend from youth unexpectedly—a welcome event no matter when or where. But at the same time, the Count was confronted by the irrefutable facts of Mishka’s appearance. Thirty pounds lighter, dressed in a threadbare coat, and dragging one leg behind him, it was no wonder that Emile had</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p286"></a>mistaken him for a beggar. Naturally, the Count had watched in recent years as age began to take its toll on the Triumvirate. He had noticed the occasional tremor in Andrey’s left hand and the creeping deafness in Emile’s right ear. He had noticed the graying of the former’s hair and the thinning of the latter’s. But with Mishka, here were not simply the ravages of time. Here were the marks of one man upon another, of an era upon its offspring. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Perhaps most striking was Mishka’s smile. In their youth, Mishka had been almost earnest to a fault and never spoke with irony. Yet when he said</p>
<p class="calibre1">“bread and salt” he wore the smile of the sarcast. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It is so good to see you, Mishka,” the Count said after a moment. “I can’t tell you how relieved I was when you sent word of your release. When did you return to Moscow?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I haven’t,” his friend replied with his new smile. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Upon the dutiful completion of his eight years, Mishka explained, he had been rewarded with a Minus Six. To visit Moscow, he had borrowed a passport from a sympathetic soul with a passing likeness. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Is that wise?” the Count asked with concern. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mishka shrugged. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I arrived this morning from Yavas by train. I’ll be returning to Yavas later tonight.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yavas . . . Where is that?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Somewhere between where the wheat is grown and the bread is eaten.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Are you teaching . . . ?” the Count asked tentatively. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No,” Mishka said with a shake of the head. “We are not encouraged to teach. But then, we are not encouraged to read or write. We are hardly encouraged to eat.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">So it was that Mishka began to describe his life in Yavas; and as he did so, he used the first person plural so often that the Count assumed he must have moved there with a fellow inmate from the camps. But slowly, it became clear that in saying “we” Mishka had no one person in mind. For Mishka, “we” encompassed  <i class="calibre3">all</i> his fellow prisoners—and not simply those he had known in Arkhangelsk. It encompassed the million or more who had toiled on the Solovetsky Islands or in Sevvostlag or on the White Sea Canal, whether they had toiled there in the twenties, or the thirties, or toiled there still. <a href="index_split_006.html#p463">*</a></p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p287"></a>Mishka was silent. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It is funny what comes to one at night,” he said after a moment. “After dropping our shovels and trudging to the barracks, we would swallow our gruel and pull our blankets to our chins eager for sleep. But inevitably some unexpected thought would come, some uninvited memory that wanted to be sized up, measured, and weighed. And many was the night I found myself thinking of that German you encountered in the bar—the one who claimed that vodka was Russia’s only contribution to the West and who challenged anyone to name three more.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I remember it well. I borrowed your observation that Tolstoy and Chekhov were the bookends of narrative, invoked Tchaikovsky, and then ordered the brute a serving of caviar.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That’s it.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mishka shook his head and then looked at the Count with his smile. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“One night some years ago, I thought of another, Sasha.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“A fifth contribution?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes, a fifth contribution: The burning of Moscow.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The Count was taken aback. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You mean in 1812?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mishka nodded. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Can you imagine the expression on Napoleon’s face when he was roused at two in the morning and stepped from his brand-new bedroom in the Kremlin only to find that the city he’d claimed just hours before had been set on fire by its citizens?” Mishka gave a quiet laugh. “Yes, the burning of Moscow was  <i class="calibre3">especially</i> Russian, my friend. Of that there can be no doubt. Because it was not a discrete event; it was the  <i class="calibre3">form</i> of an event. </p>
<p class="calibre1">One example plucked from a history of thousands. For as a people, we Russians have proven unusually adept at destroying that which we have created.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Perhaps because of his limp, Mishka no longer got up to pace the room; but the Count could see that he was pacing it with his eyes. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Every country has its grand canvas, Sasha—the so-called masterpiece that hangs in a hallowed hall and sums up the national identity for generations to come. For the French it is Delacroix’s  <i class="calibre3">Liberty Leading the</i> <i class="calibre3">People</i>; for the Dutch, Rembrandt’s  <i class="calibre3">Night Watch</i>; for the Americans, <i class="calibre3">Washington Crossing the Delaware</i>; and for we Russians? It is a pair of</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p288"></a>twins: Nikolai Ge’s  <i class="calibre3">Peter the Great Interrogating Alexei</i> and Ilya Repin’s <i class="calibre3">Ivan the Terrible and His Son</i>. For decades, these two paintings have been revered by our public, praised by our critics, and sketched by our diligent students of the arts. And yet, what do they depict? In one, our most enlightened Tsar studies his oldest son with suspicion, on the verge of condemning him to death; while in the other, unflinching Ivan cradles the body of  <i class="calibre3">his</i> eldest, having already exacted the supreme measure with a swing of the scepter to the head. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Our churches, known the world over for their idiosyncratic beauty, for their brightly colored spires and improbable cupolas, we raze one by one. </p>
<p class="calibre1">We topple the statues of old heroes and strip their names from the streets, as if they had been figments of our imagination. Our poets we either silence, or wait patiently for them to silence themselves.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mishka picked up his fork, stuck it in the untouched veal, and raised it in the air. </p>

<p class="calibre1">He gently returned the cut of meat to its plate, as if in a show of respect. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“How can we understand this, Sasha? What is it about a nation that would foster a willingness in its people to destroy their own artworks, ravage their own cities, and kill their own progeny without compunction? </p>
<p class="calibre1">To foreigners it must seem shocking. It must seem as if we Russians have such a brutish indifference that nothing, not even the fruit of our loins, is viewed as sacrosanct. And how that notion pained me. How it unsettled me. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Exhausted as I was, the very thought of it could keep me tossing until dawn. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Then one night, he came to me in a dream, Sasha: Mayakovsky himself. He quoted some lines of verse—beautiful, haunting lines that I had never heard before—about the bark of a birch tree glinting in the winter sun. Then he loaded his revolver with an exclamation point and put the barrel to his chest. When I awoke, I suddenly understood that this propensity for self-destruction was not an abomination, not something to be ashamed of or abhorred; it was our greatest strength. We turn the gun on ourselves not because we are more indifferent and less cultured than the British, or the French, or the Italians. On the contrary. We are prepared to</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p289"></a><img class="calibre2" src="index-289_1.jpg"/></p>
<p class="calibre1">destroy that which we have created because we believe more than any of them in the power of the picture, the poem, the prayer, or the person.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mishka shook his head. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Mark my words, my friend: We have not burned Moscow to the ground for the last time.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">As in the past, Mishka talked with a fevered intensity, almost as if he were making his points to himself. But once he had spoken his piece, he looked across the table and saw the distressed expression on the Count’s face. Then he suddenly laughed in a heartfelt manner, without bitterness or irony, and reached across the table to squeeze his old friend’s forearm. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I see that I have unsettled you, Sasha, with my talk of revolvers. But don’t worry. I am not through yet. I still have something to attend to. In fact, that is why I slipped into the city: to visit the library for a little project that I am working on. . . .” </p>
<p class="calibre1">With a sense of relief, the Count recognized the old spark in Mishka’s eye—the one that inevitably flashed before he threw himself headlong into a scrape. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Is it a work of poetry?” asked the Count. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Poetry? Yes, in a manner of speaking, I suppose it is. . . . But it is also something more fundamental. Something that can be built upon. I’m not ready to share it just yet; but when I am, you shall be the first.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">By the time they came out of the office and the Count led Mishka to the back stair, the kitchen was in full swing. On the counter were onions being minced, beets being sliced, hens being plucked. From the stove where six pots simmered, Emile signaled to the Count that he should wait a moment. </p>
<p class="calibre1">After wiping his hands on his apron, he came to the door with some food wrapped in brown paper. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“A little something for your journey, Mikhail Fyodorovich.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mishka looked taken aback by the offering, and for a moment the Count thought his friend was going to refuse it on principle. But Mishka thanked the chef and took the parcel in hand. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Andrey was there too now, to express his pleasure at finally meeting Mishka and to wish him well. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p290"></a><img class="calibre2" src="index-290_1.jpg"/></p>
<p class="calibre1"><img class="calibre2" src="index-290_2.jpg"/></p>
<p class="calibre1">Having returned the sentiments, Mishka opened the door to the stairwell, but then paused. Having taken a moment to look over the kitchen with all of its activity and abundance, to look from gentle Andrey to heartfelt Emile, he turned to the Count. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Who would have imagined,” he said, “when you were sentenced to life in the Metropol all those years ago, that you had just become the luckiest man in all of Russia.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">At 7:30 that evening, when the Count entered the Yellow Room, Osip tamped out his cigarette and leapt from his chair. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Ah! Here you are, Alexander. I thought a quick trip to San Franchesko was in order. We haven’t been back in a year. Get the lights, will you?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">As Osip hurried to the back of the room, the Count absently took his seat at the table for two and put his napkin in his lap. </p>
<p class="calibre1">. . . </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Alexander . . .” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The Count looked back. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The lights.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh. My apologies.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The Count rose, switched off the lights, and lingered by the wall. </p>
<p class="calibre1">. . . </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Are you going to take your seat again?” asked Osip. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Ah, yes. Of course.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The Count returned to the table and sat in Osip’s chair. </p>
<p class="calibre1">. . . </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Is everything all right, my friend? You do not seem yourself. . . .” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No, no,” assured the Count with a smile. “Everything is excellent. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Please proceed.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Osip waited for a moment to be sure, then he threw the switch and hurried back to the table as the grand old shadows began to flicker on the dining room wall. </p>


<p class="calibre1">“Just look at their Depression,” he said. “From beginning to end it lasted ten years. An entire decade in which the Proletariat was left to fend for itself, scrounging in alleys and begging at chapel doors. If ever there had been a time for the American worker to cast off the yoke, surely that was it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But did they join their brothers-in-arms? Did they shoulder their axes and splinter the doors of the mansions? Not even for an afternoon. Instead, they shuffled to the nearest movie house, where the latest fantasy was dangled before them like a pocket watch at the end of a chain. Yes, Alexander, it behooves us to study this phenomenon with the utmost diligence and care.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">So study it they did. </p>
<p class="calibre1">And the Count could confirm that Osip approached the task with the utmost diligence and care, for when a movie was playing he could hardly sit still. During the westerns, when a fight broke out in a saloon, he would clench his fists, fend off a blow, give a left to the gut, and an uppercut to the jaw. When Fyodor Astaire danced with Gingyr Rogers, his fingers would open wide and flutter about his waist while his feet shuffled back and forth on the carpet. And when Bela Lugosi emerged from the shadows, Osip leapt from his seat and nearly fell to the floor. Then, as the credits rolled, he would shake his head with an expression of moral disappointment. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Shameful,” he would say. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Scandalous.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Insidious!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Like the seasoned scientist, Osip would coolly dissect whatever they had just observed. The musicals were “pastries designed to placate the impoverished with daydreams of unattainable bliss.” The horror movies</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p292"></a><img class="calibre2" src="index-292_1.jpg"/></p>
<p class="calibre1">were “sleights of hand in which the fears of the workingman have been displaced by those of pretty girls.” The vaudevillian comedies were</p>
<p class="calibre1">“preposterous narcotics.” And the westerns? They were the most devious propaganda of all: fables in which evil is represented by collectives who rustle and rob; while virtue is a lone individual who risks his life to defend the sanctity of someone else’s private property. In sum? “Hollywood is the single most dangerous force in the history of class struggle.” </p>

<p class="calibre1">“What is this?” he would ask of no one in particular. “Who is making these movies? Under what auspices?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">From one to the next, they seemed to depict an America in which corruption and cruelty lounged on the couch; in which justice was a beggar and kindness a fool; in which loyalties were fashioned from paper, and self-interest was fashioned from steel. In other words, they provided an unflinching portrayal of Capitalism as it actually was. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“How did this happen, Alexander? Why do they allow these movies to be made? Do they not realize they are hammering a wedge beneath their own foundation stones?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">But no single star of the genre captivated Osip more than Humphrey Bogart. With the exception of  <i class="calibre3">Casablanca</i> (which Osip viewed as a woman’s movie), they had watched all of Bogart’s films at least twice. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Whether in  <i class="calibre3">The Petrified Forest</i>,  <i class="calibre3">To Have and Have Not</i>, or, especially,  <i class="calibre3"> The</i> <i class="calibre3">Maltese Falcon</i>, Osip appreciated the actor’s hardened looks, his sardonic remarks, his general lack of sentiment. “You notice how in the first act he always seems so removed and indifferent; but once his indignation is roused, Alexander, there is no one more willing to do what is necessary—to act clear-eyed, quick, and without compunction. Here truly is a Man of Intent.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">In the Yellow Room, Osip took two mouthfuls of Emile’s braised veal with caviar sauce, a gulp of Georgian wine, and looked up just in time to see the image of the Golden Gate Bridge. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p293"></a>In the minutes that followed, once again the services of Sam Spade were enlisted by the alluring, if somewhat mysterious, Miss Wonderly. Once again, Spade’s partner was gunned down in an alley just hours before Floyd Thursby met a similar fate. And once again Joel Cairo, the Fat Man, and Brigid O’Shaughnessy, having surreptitiously joined forces, drugged Spade’s whiskey and headed for the wharf, their elusive quest finally within reach. But even as Spade was nursing his head, a stranger in a black coat and hat stumbled into his office, dropped a bundle to the floor, and collapsed dead on the couch! </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Do you think Russians are particularly brutish, Osip?” asked the Count. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What’s that?” Osip whispered, as if there were others in the audience whom he didn’t want to disturb. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Do you think we are essentially more brutish than the French, or the English, or these Americans?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Alexander,” Osip hissed (as Spade was washing the stranger’s blood from his hands). “What on earth are you talking about?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I mean, do you think we are more apt than others to destroy that which we have created?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Osip, who had not yet torn his eyes from the screen, now turned to stare at the Count in disbelief. Then he abruptly rose, stomped to the projector, and froze the film at the very moment that Spade, having placed the roughly wrapped bundle on his desk, was taking his penknife from his pocket. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Is it possible that you don’t see what is happening?” he demanded while pointing at the screen. “Having traveled from the Orient to the docks of San Franchesko, Captain Jacoby has been shot five times. He has jumped from a burning ship, stumbled through the city, and used his final breaths to bring comrade Spadsky this mysterious package wrapped in paper and bound in string. And you choose this moment to engage in metaphysics!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The Count, who had turned around, was holding up a hand to cut the glare from the projection. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But, Osip,” he said, “we have watched him open the bundle on at least three occasions.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What difference does that make? You have read  <i class="calibre3">Anna Karenina</i> at least ten times, but I’d wager you still cry when she throws herself under the train.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That’s something else altogether.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p294"></a>“Is it?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">There was silence. Then with an expression of exasperation, Osip turned off the projector. He flicked on the lights and returned to the table. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“All right, my friend. I can see that you are vexed by something. Let’s see if we can make sense of it, so we can get on with our studies.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Thus, the Count described for Osip the conversation he’d had with Mishka. Or rather, he relayed Mishka’s views on the burning of Moscow, and the toppling of statues, and the silencing of poets, and the slaughter of fourteen million head of cattle. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Osip, having already aired his frustrations, now listened to the Count attentively, occasionally nodding his head at Mishka’s various points. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“All right,” he said, once the Count had finished. “So, what is it exactly that is bothering you, Alexander? Does your friend’s assertion shock you? </p>
<p class="calibre1">Does it offend your sensibilities? I understand that you are worried about his state of mind; but isn’t it possible that he is right in his opinions while being wrong in his sentiments?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What do you mean?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It is like the Maltese Falcon.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Osip. Please.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No, I am quite serious. What is the black bird if not a symbol of Western heritage itself? A sculpture fashioned by knights of the Crusades from gold and jewels as tribute to a king, it is an emblem of the church and the monarchies—those rapacious institutions that have served as the foundation for all of Europe’s art and ideas. Well, who is to say that their love of that heritage isn’t as misguided as the Fat Man’s for his falcon? </p>
<p class="calibre1">Perhaps that is  <i class="calibre3">exactly</i> what must be swept aside before their people can hope to progress.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">His tone grew softer. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The Bolsheviks are not Visigoths, Alexander. We are not the barbarian hordes descending upon Rome and destroying all that is fine out of ignorance and envy. It is the opposite. In 1916, Russia was a barbarian state. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It was the most illiterate nation in Europe, with the majority of its population living in modified serfdom: tilling the fields with wooden plows, beating their wives by candlelight, collapsing on their benches drunk with vodka, and then waking at dawn to humble themselves before their icons. </p>
<p class="calibre1">That is, living exactly as their forefathers had lived five hundred years</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p295"></a><img class="calibre2" src="index-295_1.jpg"/></p>
<p class="calibre1">before. Is it not possible that our reverence for all the statues and cathedrals and ancient institutions was precisely what was holding us back?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Osip paused, taking a moment to refill their glasses with wine. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But where do we stand now? How far have we come? By marrying American tempo with Soviet aims, we are on the verge of  <i class="calibre3">universal</i> literacy. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Russia’s long-suffering women, our second serfdom, have been elevated to the status of equals. We have built whole new cities and our industrial production outpaces that of most of Europe.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But at what cost?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Osip slapped the table. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“At the greatest cost! But do you think the achievements of the Americans—envied the world over—came without a cost? Just ask their African brothers. And do you think the engineers who designed their illustrious skyscrapers or built their highways hesitated for one moment to level the lovely little neighborhoods that stood in their way? I guarantee you, Alexander, they laid the dynamite and pushed the plungers themselves. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As I’ve said to you before, we and the Americans will lead the rest of this century because we are the only nations who have learned to brush the past aside instead of bowing before it. But where they have done so in service of their beloved individualism, we are attempting to do so in service of the common good.” </p>

<p class="calibre1">Hunched over with his arms outstretched, shifting back and forth on the balls of his feet, he was relaying his tale like a wrestler on the mat. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“. . . Sidestepping the Monsignor, old Porterhouse slowly advanced upon the second goose, waiting for his prey to look him in the eye. That’s the secret, you see: the looking in the eye. That’s the moment Porterhouse lets his adversaries imagine for a second that they are his equals. Having</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p296"></a>taken two steps to the left, Porterhouse suddenly took three to the right. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Thrown off balance, the goose met the old boy’s gaze—and that’s when Porterhouse leapt!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The aide-de-camp leapt. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The two hostesses shrieked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Then giggled. </p>
<p class="calibre1">When the aide-de-camp stood back to his full height, he was holding a pineapple. With one hand around its throat and the other under its tail, the captain displayed the fruit for all to see, just as the general had displayed the second goose. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“And it was at this fateful juncture that the good general’s sash unsashed and his robe disrobed, revealing a regulation pair of U.S. Army–issue briefs</p>
<p class="calibre1">—at the sight of which, Madame Veloshki fainted.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">As the audience applauded, the aide-de-camp gave a bow. Then he set the pineapple gently on the bar and lifted his drink. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Madame Veloshki’s response seems perfectly understandable,” said one of the journalists. “But what did  <i class="calibre3">you</i> do when you saw the old man’s briefs?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What did I do?” exclaimed the aide-de-camp. “Why, I saluted them, of course.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">As the others laughed, he emptied his drink. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Now, gentlemen, I suggest we head out into the night. I can tell you from personal experience that over at the National can be heard the sorriest samba in the Northern Hemisphere. The drummer, who is blind in one eye, can’t hit his cymbals. And the bandleader hasn’t the slightest sense of a Latin tempo. The closest he has come to South America is when he fell down a flight of mahogany stairs. But he has excellent intentions and a toupee that has descended from heaven.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">With that, the motley assembly stumbled into the night, leaving the Count to approach the bar in relative peace and quiet. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Good evening, Audrius.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Good evening, Count Rostov. What is your pleasure?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“A glass of Armagnac, perhaps.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">A moment later, as the Count gave the brandy in his snifter a swirl, he found himself smiling at the aide-de-camp’s portrayal—which in turn led him to reflect on the personality of Americans in general. In his persuasive</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p297"></a>fashion, Osip had argued that during the Depression, Hollywood had undermined the inevitable forces of revolution by means of its elaborate chicanery. But the Count wondered if Osip didn’t have his analysis upside down. Certainly, it seemed true that glittering musicals and slapstick comedies had flourished during the 1930s in America. But so too had jazz and skyscrapers. Were these also narcotics designed to put a restless nation to sleep? Or were they signs of a native spirit so irrepressible that even a Depression couldn’t squelch it? </p>
<p class="calibre1">As the Count gave another swirl of his brandy, a customer sat three stools to his left. To the Count’s surprise, it was the aide-de-camp. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ever attentive, Audrius leaned with his forearm on the bar. “Welcome back, Captain.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Thank you, Audrius.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What can I do for you?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Same as before, I suppose.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">As Audrius turned away to prepare the drink, the captain drummed his hands on the bar and looked idly about. When he met the Count’s gaze, he gave a nod and a friendly smile. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You’re not headed for the National?” the Count couldn’t help but ask. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It seems my friends were in such a hurry to accompany me that they left me behind,” the American replied. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The Count gave a sympathetic smile. “I’m sorry to hear it.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No. Please don’t be. I’m quite fond of being left behind. It always gives me a whole new perspective on wherever it was I thought I was leaving. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Besides, I’m off first thing in the morning to head home for a spell, so it’s probably for the best.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He extended his hand to the Count. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Richard Vanderwhile.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Alexander Rostov.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The captain gave another friendly nod and then, having looked away, suddenly looked back. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Weren’t you my waiter last night at the Boyarsky?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes, I was.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The captain let out a sigh of relief. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Thank God. Otherwise, I would have had to cancel my drink.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p298"></a>As if on cue, Audrius placed it on the bar. The captain took a sip and gave another sigh, this one of satisfaction. Then he studied the Count for a moment. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Are you Russian?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“To the core.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well then, let me say at the outset that I am positively enamored with your country. I love your funny alphabet and those little pastries stuffed with meat. But your nation’s notion of a cocktail is rather unnerving. . . .” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“How so?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The captain pointed discreetly down the bar to where a bushy-eyebrowed apparatchik was chatting with a young brunette. Both of them were holding drinks in a striking shade of magenta. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I gather from Audrius that that concoction contains ten different ingredients. In addition to vodka, rum, brandy, and grenadine, it boasts an extraction of rose, a dash of bitters, and a melted lollipop. But a cocktail is not meant to be a mélange. It is not a potpourri or an Easter parade. At its best, a cocktail should be crisp, elegant, sincere—and limited to two ingredients.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Just two?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes. But they must be two ingredients that complement each other; that laugh at each other’s jokes and make allowances for each other’s faults; and that never shout over each other in conversation. Like gin and tonic,” he said, pointing to his drink. “Or bourbon and water . . . Or whiskey and soda . . .” Shaking his head, he raised his glass and drank from it. “Excuse me for expounding.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That’s quite all right.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The captain nodded in gratitude, but then after a moment inquired, “Do you mind if I make an observation? I mean of the personal sort.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Not at all,” said the Count. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The captain slid his drink down the bar and moved a stool closer. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You seem like something is weighing on your mind. I mean, you set that brandy in motion about half an hour ago. If you’re not careful, the vortex you’ve created will drill a hole right through the floor and we’ll all end up in the basement.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The Count set the snifter down with a laugh. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I suppose you’re right. Something must be weighing on my mind.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p299"></a>“Well then,” said Richard, gesturing to the empty bar, “you have come to the right place. Since days of old, well-mannered men have assembled in watering holes such as this one in order to unburden themselves in the company of sympathetic souls.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Or strangers?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The captain raised a finger in the air. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“There are no more sympathetic souls  <i class="calibre3">than</i> strangers. So, what say we skip the preambling. Is it women? Money? Writer’s block?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The Count laughed again; and then like other well-mannered men since days of old, he unburdened himself to this sympathetic soul. He described Mishka and his notion that Russians were somehow unusually adept at destroying that which they have created. Then he described Osip and his notion that Mishka was perfectly right, but that the destruction of monuments and masterpieces was essential to the progress of a nation. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh, so that’s it,” said the captain, as if this would have been his fourth guess. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes. But what conclusions would you draw from it all?” asked the Count. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What conclusions?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Richard took a drink. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I think that both of your friends are very sharp. I mean it takes a good bit of dexterity to pull a thread out of the fabric all in one piece. But I can’t help feeling that they’re missing something. . . .” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He drummed his fingers on the bar as he tried to formulate his thoughts. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I understand that there’s a little history of dismantling here in Russia; and that the razing of a beautiful old building is bound to engender a little sorrow for what’s gone and some excitement for what’s to come. But when all is said and done, I can’t help suspecting that grand things persist. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Take that fellow Socrates. Two thousand years ago, he wandered around the marketplace sharing his thoughts with whomever he bumped into; and he wouldn’t even take the time to write them down. Then, in something of a fix, he punched his own ticket; pulled his own plug; collapsed his own umbrella. Adios. Adieu. Finis. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Time marched on, as it will. The Romans took over. Then the barbarians. And then we threw the whole Middle Ages at him. Hundreds of years of plagues and poisonings and the burning of books. And somehow, </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p300"></a><img class="calibre2" src="index-300_1.jpg"/></p>
<p class="calibre1">after all of that, the grand things this fellow happened to say in the marketplace are still with us. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I guess the point I’m trying to make is that as a species we’re just no good at writing obituaries. We don’t know how a man or his achievements will be perceived three generations from now, any more than we know what his great-great-grandchildren will be having for breakfast on a Tuesday in March. Because when Fate hands something down to posterity, it does so behind its back.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">They were both silent for a moment. Then the captain emptied his glass and pointed a finger at the Count’s brandy. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Tell me, though, is that thing pulling its weight?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">When the Count left the Shalyapin an hour later (having joined Captain Vanderwhile for two rounds of Audrius’s magenta-colored concoction), he was surprised to see Sofia still reading in the lobby. Catching her eye, he gave a little wave and she gave a little wave back before returning to her book, demurely. . . . </p>
<p class="calibre1">It took all of the Count’s presence of mind to cross the lobby at a stroll. </p>
<p class="calibre1">With the undeniable appearance of a man at ease, he carefully mounted the stairs and slowly began to ascend. But the moment he turned the corner, he broke into a sprint. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As he vaulted upward, he could barely contain his sense of glee. The hidden genius of Sofia’s game had always been that she chose when it was played. Naturally, she would wait for those moments when he was distracted or off his guard, such that the game was generally over before he even knew it had begun. But tonight, things were going to be different—</p>
<p class="calibre1">because by the casualness of Sofia’s wave, the Count could tell the game was afoot. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I’ve got her now, he thought as he passed the second floor with a sinister little laugh. But as he turned the landing on the third floor, he was forced to acknowledge a second advantage that Sofia had in this game: her youth. For without question, his pace had begun to slow considerably. If his shortness of breath was any indication, he would be crawling by the time he reached</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p301"></a>the sixth floor—assuming he reached it alive. To be on the safe side, when he got to the fifth floor he slowed his pace to a purposeful walk. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Opening the door to the belfry, he paused to listen. Looking down the stairs, he couldn’t see a thing. Could she have already flown past? </p>
<p class="calibre1">Impossible. She hadn’t the time. Still, on the off chance that she had transported herself by means of witchcraft, the Count climbed the final flight on the tips of his toes and when he opened their door, he did so with an affect of indifference—only to find that, in fact, the room was empty. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Rubbing his hands together, he wondered:  <i class="calibre3">Where should I place myself? </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">He considered climbing into bed and acting like he was asleep, but he wanted to see the expression on her face. So he sat in the desk chair, tilted it back on two legs, and grabbed the closest book at hand, which happened to be Monsieur Montaigne. Opening the tome at random, he landed on the essay “Of the Education of Children.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Just so,” he said with a wily smile. Then he adopted an expression of perfect erudition as he pretended to read. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But after five minutes, she hadn’t appeared. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Ah, well. I must have been mistaken,” he was conceding with some disappointment, when the door flung open. But it wasn’t Sofia. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It was one of the chambermaids. In a state of distress. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Ilana. What is it?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It’s Sofia! She has fallen!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The Count leapt from his chair. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Fallen! Where?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“In the service stair.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The Count brushed past the chambermaid and bolted down the belfry. </p>
<p class="calibre1">After two flights of empty stairs, a voice in some corner of his mind began to reason that Ilana must have been mistaken; but as he rounded the third-floor landing, there Sofia was—splayed across the steps, her eyes closed, her hair matted with blood. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh, my God.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The Count fell to his knees. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Sofia . . .” </p>
<p class="calibre1">She didn’t respond. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Gently raising her head, the Count could see the gash above her brow. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Her skull did not appear compromised, but she was bleeding and</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p302"></a>unconscious. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ilana was behind him now, in tears. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I will go for a doctor,” she said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But it was after eleven. Who could say how long that would take? </p>
<p class="calibre1">The Count slid his arms under Sofia’s neck and knees, lifted her off the steps, and carried her down the remaining flights. At the ground floor, he pushed the door open with his shoulder and cut through the lobby. Only in the most remote sense was he aware of a middle-aged couple waiting for the elevator; of Vasily at his desk; of voices in the bar. And suddenly, he found himself on the steps of the Metropol in the warm summer air—for the first time in over twenty years. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Rodion, the night doorman, looked at the Count in shock. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“A taxi,” the Count said. “I need a taxi.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Over the doorman’s shoulder, he could see four of them parked fifty feet from the entrance, waiting for the last of the Shalyapin’s customers. Two drivers at the front of the line were smoking and chatting. Before Rodion could raise his whistle to his lips, the Count was running toward them. </p>
<p class="calibre1">When the drivers noted the Count’s approach, the expression on one’s face was a knowing smirk and on the other’s a look of condemnation—</p>
<p class="calibre1">having both concluded that the gentleman had a drunken girl in his arms. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But they stood to attention when they saw the blood on her face. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“My daughter,” said the Count. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Here,” said one of the drivers, throwing his cigarette on the ground and running to open the back door of the cab. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“To St. Anselm’s,” said the Count. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“St. Anselm’s . . . ?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“As fast as you can.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Putting the car in gear, the driver pulled onto Theatre Square and headed north as the Count, pressing a folded handkerchief against Sofia’s wound with one hand and combing her hair with the other, murmured assurances that went unheard—while the streets of the city raced past unregarded. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In a matter of minutes, the cab came to a stop. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We’re here,” said the driver. He got out and opened the back door. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The Count carefully slipped out with Sofia in his arms then suddenly stopped. “I have no money,” he said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What money! For God’s sake, go.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p303"></a>The Count crossed the curb and rushed toward the hospital, but even as he passed through its doors, he knew that he had made a terrible mistake. In the entry hall, there were grown men sleeping on benches, like refugees in a railway station. Hallway lights flickered as if powered by a faulty generator, and in the air was the smell of ammonia and cigarette smoke. When the Count had been a young man, St. Anselm’s had been among the finest hospitals in the city. But that was thirty years ago. By now, the Bolsheviks had presumably built new hospitals—modern, bright, and clean—and this old facility had been left behind as some sort of clinic for veterans, the homeless, and the otherwise forsaken. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Sidestepping a man who appeared to be asleep on his feet, the Count approached a desk where a young nurse was reading. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It is my daughter,” he said. “She has been injured.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Looking up, the nurse dropped her magazine. She disappeared through a door. After what seemed like an eternity, she returned with a young man in the white jacket of an internist. The Count held Sofia out while pulling back the blood-soaked handkerchief to show the wound. The internist ran his hand across his mouth. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“This girl should be seen by a surgeon,” he said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Is there one here?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What? No, of course not.” He looked at a clock on the wall. “At six, perhaps.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“At six? Surely, she needs attention now. You must do something.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The internist rubbed his hand across his mouth again and then turned to the nurse. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Find Dr. Kraznakov. Have him report to Surgery Four.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">As the nurse disappeared again, the internist wheeled over a gurney. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Lay her here and come with me.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">With the Count at his side, the internist pushed Sofia down a hall and into an elevator. Once on the third floor, they passed through a pair of swinging doors into a long hallway in which there were two other gurneys, each with a sleeping patient. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“In there.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The Count pushed open the door and the internist wheeled Sofia into Surgery Four. It was a cold room, tiled from floor to ceiling. In one corner, the tiles had begun falling from the plaster. There was a surgical table, </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p304"></a>craning lights, and a standing tray. After some minutes, the door opened and an ill-shaven physician entered with the young nurse. He looked as if he had just been wakened. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What is it?” he said in a weary voice. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“A young girl with a head injury, Dr. Kraznakov.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“All right, all right,” he said. Then waving a hand at the Count, he added: “No visitors in the surgery.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The internist took the Count by the elbow. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Wait a second,” the Count said. “Is this man capable?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Looking at the Count, Kraznakov grew red in the face. “What did he say?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The Count continued to address the young internist. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You said she needed to be seen by a surgeon. Is this man a surgeon?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Get him out of here, I tell you!” shouted Kraznakov. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But the door to the surgery swung open again and a tall man in his late forties entered in the company of a primly dressed associate. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Who is in charge here?” he asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I am in charge,” said Kraznakov. “Who are you? What is this?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Brushing Kraznakov aside, the newcomer approached the table and leaned over Sofia. He gingerly parted her hair to examine the wound. He raised one of her eyelids with a thumb and then took her pulse by holding her wrist and glancing at his watch. Only then did he turn to Kraznakov. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’m Lazovsky, chief of surgery at First Municipal. I will be seeing to this patient.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What’s that? Now listen here!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Lazovsky turned to the Count. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Are you Rostov?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes,” said the Count, astounded. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Tell me when and how this happened. Be as precise as you can.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“She fell while running up a staircase. I think she hit her head on the edge of the landing. It was at the Metropol Hotel. It couldn’t have been more than thirty minutes ago.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Had she been drinking?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What? No. She’s a child.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“How old?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Thirteen.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p305"></a>“Her name?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Sofia.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“All right. Very good.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ignoring Kraznakov’s ongoing protests, Lazovsky turned his attention to the primly dressed associate and began giving her instructions: that she find scrubs for the team and a suitable place to wash; that she gather the necessary surgical tools; that she sterilize everything. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The door swung open and a young man appeared, wearing the cavalier expression of one who has just come from a ball. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Good evening, comrade Lazovsky,” he said with a smile. “What a charming place you have here.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“All right, Antonovich. That’ll be enough of that. It’s a fracture at the front of the left parietal bone with a likely risk of subdural hematoma. Suit up. And see if you can do something about this lighting.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes, sir.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But first, get them out of here.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">As Antonovich began corralling the two resident physicians out of the surgery with his carefree smile, Lazovsky pointed at the young nurse who had been manning the desk downstairs. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Not you. Get yourself ready to assist.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Then he turned to the Count. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Your daughter has taken quite a crack, Rostov, but she hasn’t fallen headfirst from a plane. The skull was designed to withstand a certain amount of rough treatment. In these sorts of cases, the greatest risk is from swelling rather than direct damage. But that’s nothing we haven’t dealt with before. We’re going to attend to your daughter immediately. In the meantime, you will need to sit outside. I will come and report to you as soon as I can.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The Count was led to a bench right outside the surgery. It took him a few moments to realize that in the preceding minutes the hallway had been cleared: the two gurneys with their sleeping patients were gone. The door at the end of the hallway suddenly swung open to admit Antonovich, who was now in scrubs and whistling. As the door swung closed, the Count could see that a man in a black suit had held the door open for him. When Antonovich went back into Surgery Four, the Count was alone in the empty hallway. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p306"></a>How did he spend the ensuing minutes? How would any man spend them. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He prayed for the first time since childhood. He allowed himself to imagine the worst, then assured himself that everything would be all right, reviewing the surgeon’s few remarks over and over. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The skull was designed for rough treatment,” he repeated to himself. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Yet against his will, he was visited by contrary examples. He recalled a genial woodsman from the village of Petrovskoye, for instance, who had been hit in the head in the prime of his life by a falling limb. When he regained consciousness, he was as strong as ever, but sullen; on occasion he failed to recognize his friends; and without the slightest provocation he could explode in anger toward his own sisters—as if he’d been put to bed one man and had risen from bed another. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The Count began to chastise himself: How could he have let Sofia play such a reckless game? How could he while away an hour in a bar fretting over history paintings and statues—while Fate was preparing to hold his daughter’s life in the balance? </p>
<p class="calibre1">For all the varied concerns attendant to the raising of a child—over schoolwork, dress, and manners—in the end, a parent’s responsibility could not be more simple: To bring a child safely into adulthood so that she could have a chance to experience a life of purpose and, God willing, contentment. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Untold minutes passed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The door to the surgery opened and Dr. Lazovsky appeared. He had his mask pulled below his chin. His hands were bare but there was blood on his smock. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The Count leapt up. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Please, Rostov,” said the surgeon. “Have a seat.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The Count sat back on the bench. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Lazovsky didn’t join him; rather he put his fists on his hips and looked down at the Count with an unmistakable expression of competence. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“As I told you, in these situations the greatest risk is swelling. We have alleviated that risk. Nonetheless, she has suffered a concussion, which is basically a bruising of the brain. She is going to have headaches and will need a good deal of rest. But in a week, she will be up and about.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The surgeon turned to go. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p307"></a>The Count extended a hand. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Dr. Lazovsky . . . ,” he said, in the manner of one who wishes to ask a question, yet suddenly can’t find the means of doing so. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But the surgeon, who had stood in this spot before, understood well enough. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“She’s going to be every bit herself, Rostov.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">As the Count began to offer his thanks, the man in the black suit opened the door at the end of the hall once again, only this time it was for Osip Glebnikov. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Excuse me,” said the surgeon to the Count. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Meeting halfway down the hall, Osip and Lazovsky conferred for a minute in lowered voices while the Count watched in astonishment. When the surgeon disappeared into the surgery, Osip joined the Count on the bench. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well, my friend,” he said with his hands on his knees. “Your little Sofia has given us quite a scare.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Osip . . . What are you doing here?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I wanted to make sure that you were both all right.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But how did you come to find us?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Osip smiled. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“As I’ve told you, Alexander, it is my business to keep track of certain men of interest. But that doesn’t matter at the moment. What does matter is that Sofia’s going to be fine. Lazovsky is the best surgeon in the city. </p>

<p class="calibre1">The Count began to protest, but Osip raised a calming hand. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Listen to me, Sasha. If I know what has happened tonight, others will soon know too. And it would not be in your best interest, or <i class="calibre3"> Sofia’s</i> for that matter, if they were to find you sitting here. So this is what you must do: There is a staircase at that end of this hall. You need to go down to the ground floor and through the black metal door, which leads to the alley behind the hospital. In the alley, there will be two men waiting who will take you back to the hotel.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I can’t leave Sofia,” said the Count. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You have to, I’m afraid. But your concern is perfectly understandable. </p>
<p class="calibre1">So I have arranged for someone to stay with Sofia in your stead until she is</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p308"></a>ready to go home.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">At this remark, the door was opened to admit a middle-aged woman looking bewildered and frightened. It was Marina. Behind the seamstress was a matron in uniform. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Ah,” said Osip, standing. “Here she is.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Because Osip stood, Marina looked to him first. Having never seen him before, she met his gaze with anxiety. But then she saw the Count sitting on the bench and ran forward. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Alexander! What has happened? What are you doing here? They wouldn’t tell me a thing.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It’s Sofia, Marina. She had a bad fall on the service stairs of the hotel, but a surgeon is with her now. She is going to be all right.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Thank God.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The Count turned to Osip as if he were about to introduce him, but Osip preempted. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Osip laid a hand on the Count’s shoulder without taking his gaze off Marina. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I know it is a great deal to ask, Marina,” said the Count. “But . . .” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Not another word, Alexander. Of course I will stay.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Excellent,” said Osip. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He turned to the uniformed woman. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You’ll see that comrade Samarova receives everything that she requires?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes, sir.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Osip offered Marina one more reassuring smile and then took the Count by the elbow. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“This way, my friend.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Osip led the Count down the hall and into the back staircase. They descended a flight together without speaking and then Osip stopped on the landing. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“This is where we part. Remember: down another flight and out the black metal door. Naturally, it would be best if you never mentioned to</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p309"></a>anyone that either of us were here.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Osip, I don’t know how to repay you.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Alexander,” he said with a smile, “you have been at my service for over fifteen years. It is a pleasure for once to be at yours.” Then he was gone. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The Count descended the last flight and went through the black metal door. It was nearly dawn and, despite finding himself in an alley, the Count could sense the gentleness of spring in the air. Across the alley, there was a white van with the words  <i class="calibre3">Red Star Baking Collective</i> painted in large letters on its side. An ill-shaven young man was leaning against the passenger door smoking. When he saw the Count, he tossed his cigarette and thumped the door behind him. Without asking the Count who he was, he went behind the van and opened the rear door. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Thank you,” said the Count as he climbed inside, receiving no reply. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It was only when the door closed and the Count found himself bent over at the waist in the back of the van that he became aware of an extraordinary sensation: the smell of freshly baked bread. When he had seen the insignia of the baking collective, he had assumed it was a ruse. But on the shelves that ran along one side of the van were over two hundred loaves in orderly arrangement. Gently, almost in disbelief, the Count reached out to lay a hand on one and found it to be soft and warm. It couldn’t have been more than an hour from the oven. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Outside, the passenger door slammed shut and the van’s engine started. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The Count quickly sat on the metal bench that faced the shelves and they were underway. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In the silence, the Count listened to the gears of the van shifting. Having sped up and slowed down as it came into and out of various turns, the van’s engine now accelerated to the speed of an open road. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Shuffling to the rear of the van with his back hunched, the Count looked out the little square window in the door. As he watched the buildings and canopies and shop signs flying past, for a moment he couldn’t tell where he was. Then suddenly he saw the old English Club and realized that they must be on Tverskaya—the ancient road that radiated from the Kremlin in the direction of St. Petersburg, and that he had strolled a thousand times before. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In the late 1930s, Tverskaya Street had been widened to accommodate the official parades that ended in Red Square. While at the time, some of the</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p310"></a><img class="calibre2" src="index-310_1.jpg"/></p>
<p class="calibre1">finer buildings had been lifted and set back, most had been razed and replaced with towers, in accordance with a new ordinance that buildings on first-rate streets stand at least ten stories tall. As a result, the Count would have had to strain to pick out other familiar landmarks as the van moved along. But he had stopped looking for what was familiar, and instead was watching the blur of facades and street lamps receding rapidly from his view, as if they were being pulled into the distance. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Back in the attic of the Metropol, the Count found his door still open and Montaigne on the floor. Picking up his father’s book, the Count sat down on Sofia’s bed. Then for the first time that night, he let himself weep, his chest heaving lightly with the release. But if tears fell freely down his face, they were not tears of grief. They were the tears of the luckiest man in all of Russia. </p>
<p class="calibre1">After a few minutes, the Count breathed deeply and felt a sense of peace. Realizing that his father’s book was still in his hand, he rose from Sofia’s bed to set it down—and that’s when he saw the black leather case that had been left on the Grand Duke’s desk. It was about a foot square and six inches high with a handle in leather and clasps of chrome. Taped on top was a note addressed to him in an unfamiliar script. Pulling the note free, the Count unfolded it and read:</p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">Alexander, </i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">What a pleasure meeting you tonight. As I mentioned, I am</i> <i class="calibre3">headed home for a spell. In the meantime, I thought you could make</i> <i class="calibre3">good use of this. You might pay special attention to the contents in</i> <i class="calibre3">the uppermost sleeve, as I think you will find it very apropos of our</i> <i class="calibre3">chat. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">With warm regards till next we meet, </i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">Richard Vanderwhile</i></p>
<p class="calibre1">Throwing the clasps, the Count opened the lid of the case. It was a portable phonograph. Inside there was a small stack of records in brown</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p311"></a>paper sleeves. Per Richard’s suggestion, the Count singled out the uppermost disc. On the label at the center, it was identified as a recording of Vladimir Horowitz playing Tchaikovsky’s First Piano Concerto at Carnegie Hall in New York. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The Count had seen Horowitz perform in Moscow in 1921, less than four years before the pianist traveled to Berlin for an official concert—with a wad of foreign currency tucked in his shoes. . . . </p>
<p class="calibre1">At the back of the case, the Count found a small compartment in which the electrical cord was folded away. Unraveling it, he plugged the player into the wall socket. He removed the record from its sleeve, placed it on the turntable, threw the switch, cued the needle, and sat back on Sofia’s bed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">At first, he heard muted voices, a few coughs, and the last rustling of an audience settling in; then silence; then heartfelt applause as the performer presumably took the stage. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The Count held his breath. </p>
<p class="calibre1">After the trumpets sounded their first martial notes, the strings swelled, and then his countryman began to play, evoking for the American audience the movement of a wolf through the birches, the wind across the steppe, the flicker of a candle in a ballroom, and the flash of a cannon at Borodino. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p312"></a><img class="calibre2" src="index-312_1.jpg"/></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3"><b class="calibre4">Addendum</b></i></p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre4">O</b>n the twenty-third of June at four in the afternoon, Andrey Duras was riding the bus back to his apartment in the Arbat, having taken advantage of his day off to visit Sofia at First Municipal Hospital. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The next day, he looked forward to reporting at the daily meeting of the Triumvirate that she was in good spirits. Housed in a special wing of the hospital, she had a private room full of sunlight, and constant attention from a battalion of nurses. Emile would be pleased to learn that his cookies were well received and that Sofia promised to send word the minute she had run out. While for his part, Andrey had brought a book of adventure stories that had always been a favorite of his son’s. </p>
<p class="calibre1">At Smolenskaya Square, Andrey gave his seat to an older woman. He would be disembarking in a few blocks anyway—to get some cucumbers and potatoes at the peasant market in the square. Emile had given him half a pound of minced pork, and he was going to make kotlety for his wife. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Andrey and his wife lived in a narrow four-story apartment building in the middle of the block. Theirs was one of the smallest of the sixteen apartments, but they had it to themselves. At least, for now. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Having completed his errand at the market, Andrey climbed the stairs to the third floor. As he passed the other doors along the hallway, he could smell onions being sautéed in one apartment and hear voices on the radio in another. Shifting the bag of groceries to his left arm, he took out his key. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Letting himself inside, Andrey called out to his wife, though he knew she wouldn’t be home. She would be waiting in line at the new milk store that had opened in a decommissioned church on the other side of the neighborhood. She said the milk there was fresher and the line was shorter, but Andrey knew this wasn’t true. Like so many others, she went there</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p313"></a>because the small chapel at the back of the church had a mosaic of  <i class="calibre3">Christ</i> <i class="calibre3">and the Woman at the Well</i> that no one had bothered to dismantle; and the women who waited in line for their milk were willing to hold your place while you slipped away to pray. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Many years before, Andrey had visited Pushkin’s apartment in St. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Petersburg—the one where he’d lived in his final years. The rooms of the apartment had been preserved just as they’d been on the day the poet died. </p>
<p class="calibre1">There was even an unfinished poem and pen sitting on the desk. At the time, standing behind the little rope and gazing at the poet’s desk, Andrey had thought the whole venture rather preposterous—as if by keeping a few belongings in place, one might actually protect a moment from the relentless onslaught of time. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But when Ilya, their only child, was killed in the Battle of Berlin—just months before the end of the war—he and his wife had done the same thing: leaving every blanket, every book, every piece of clothing exactly where it had been on the day that they’d received the news. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Initially, Andrey had to admit, this had been a great comfort. When he was alone in the apartment, he would find himself visiting the room; and when he did so, he could see from the depression on the bed where his wife must have been sitting while he was at work. Now, though, he worried that this carefully preserved room had begun to sustain rather than alleviate their grief; and he knew the time had come for them to rid themselves of their son’s belongings. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Though he knew this, he didn’t raise the matter with his wife. For he also knew that soon enough, someone in the building would draw the attention of the housing authorities to their son’s death; then they would be</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p314"></a>moved to an even smaller apartment or required to take in a stranger, and life would reclaim the room as its own. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But even as he had this thought, Andrey walked over to the bed and smoothed out the blankets where his wife had been sitting; and only then, did he turn out the light. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p315"></a><img class="calibre2" src="index-315_1.jpg"/></p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre4">BOOK FOUR</b></p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p316"></a><b class="calibre4">1950</b></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3"><b class="calibre4">Adagio, Andante, Allegro</b></i></p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre4">I</b>n the blink of an eye.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">That was how, on the twenty-first of June, Count Alexander Rostov summed up his daughter’s journey from thirteen to seventeen, when Vasily remarked on how much she had grown. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“One moment she is scampering up and down the stairwells—a veritable gadabout, a gadfly, a ne’er-do-well—and the next, she is a young woman of intelligence and refinement.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">And this was largely true. For if the Count had been premature in characterizing Sofia as demure when she was thirteen, he had perfectly anticipated her persona on the cusp of adulthood. With fair skin and long black hair (but for the white stripe that fell from the spot of her old injury), Sofia could sit for hours listening to music in their study. She could stitch for hours with Marina in the stitching room, or chat for hours with Emile in the kitchen without shifting once in her chair. </p>
<p class="calibre1">When Sofia was just five, the Count had assumed, naively perhaps, that she would grow up to be a dark-haired version of her mother. But while Sofia shared Nina’s clarity of perception and confidence of opinion, she was entirely different in demeanor. Where her mother was prone to express her impatience with the slightest of the world’s imperfections, Sofia seemed to presume that if the earth spun awry upon occasion, it was generally a well-intentioned planet. And where Nina would not hesitate to cut someone off in midassertion in order to make a contrary point and then declare the matter decided once and for all, Sofia would listen so attentively and with such a sympathetic smile that her interlocutor, having been given free rein to express his views at considerable length, often found his voice petering out as he began to question his own premises. . . . </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p317"></a>Demure. That was the only word for it. And the transition had occurred in the blink of an eye. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“When you reach our age, Vasily, it all goes by so quickly. Whole seasons seem to pass without leaving the slightest mark on our memory.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“How true . . . ,” agreed the concierge (as he sorted through an allotment of tickets). </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But surely, there is a comfort to be taken from that,” continued the Count. “For even as the weeks begin racing by in a blur for us, they are making the greatest of impressions upon our children. When one turns seventeen and begins to experience that first period of real independence, one’s senses are so alert, one’s sentiments so finely attuned that every conversation, every look, every laugh may be writ indelibly upon one’s memory. And the friends that one happens to make in those impressionable years? One will meet them forever after with a welling of affection.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Having expressed this paradox, the Count happened to look across the lobby, where Grisha was lugging the luggage of one guest toward the front desk as Genya lugged the luggage of another toward the door. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Perhaps it is a matter of celestial balance,” he reflected. “A sort of cosmic equilibrium. Perhaps the aggregate experience of Time is a constant and thus for our children to establish such vivid impressions of this particular June, we must relinquish our claims upon it.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“So that they might remember, we must forget,” Vasily summed up. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Exactly!” said the Count. “So that they might remember, we must forget. But should we take umbrage at the fact? Should we feel shortchanged by the notion that their experiences for the moment may be richer than ours? I think not. For it is hardly our purpose at this late stage to log a new portfolio of lasting memories. Rather, we should be dedicating ourselves to ensuring that  <i class="calibre3">they</i> taste freely of experience. And we must do so without trepidation. Rather than tucking in blankets and buttoning up coats, we must have faith in them to tuck and button on their own. And if they fumble with their newfound liberty, we must remain composed, generous, judicious. We must encourage them to venture out from under our watchful gaze, and then sigh with pride when they pass at last through the revolving doors of life. . . .” </p>
<p class="calibre1">As if to illustrate, the Count gestured generously and judiciously toward the hotel’s entrance, while giving an exemplary sigh. Then he tapped the</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p318"></a><img class="calibre2" src="index-318_1.jpg"/></p>
<p class="calibre1">concierge’s desk. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“By the way. Do you happen to know where she is?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Vasily looked up from his tickets. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Miss Sofia?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“She is in the ballroom with Viktor, I believe.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Ah. She must be helping him polish the floors for an upcoming banquet.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No. Not Viktor Ivanovich. Viktor Stepanovich.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Viktor Stepanovich?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes. Viktor Stepanovich Skadovsky. The conductor of the orchestra at the Piazza.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">If in part, the Count had been trying to express to Vasily how in our golden years a passage of time can be so fleet and leave so little an impression upon our memory, that it is almost as if it never occurred—well then, here was a perfect example. </p>
<p class="calibre1">For the three minutes it took the Count to travel from a delightful conversation at the concierge’s desk to the ballroom, where he had grabbed a scoundrel by the lapels, had also passed in the blink of an eye. Why, it had passed so quickly, that the Count did not remember knocking the luggage from Grisha’s grip as he marched down the hall; nor did he remember throwing open the door and shouting  <i class="calibre3">Aha! </i>; nor yanking the would-be Casanova up off the loveseat, where he had intertwined his fingers with Sofia’s. </p>
<p class="calibre1">No, the Count did not remember any of it. But to ensure a celestial balance and the equilibrium of the cosmos, this moustachioed scoundrel in evening clothes was sure to remember every single second for the rest of his life. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Your Excellency,” he implored, as he dangled in the air. “There has been a terrible misunderstanding!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Looking up at the startled face above his fists, the Count confirmed that there had been no misunderstanding. It was definitely the very same fellow who waved his baton so blithely on the bandstand in the Piazza. And</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p319"></a>though he apparently knew how to produce an honorific in a timely fashion, he was clearly as villainous a viper as had ever slithered from the underbrush of Eden. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But whatever his level of villainy, the current situation did pose a quandary. For once you have hoisted a scoundrel by the lapels, what are you to do with him? At least when you have a fellow by the scruff of the neck, you can carry him out the door and toss him down the stairs. But when you have him by the lapels, he isn’t so easy to dispense with. Before the Count could solve his conundrum, Sofia expressed a conundrum of her own. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Papa! What are you doing?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Go to your room, Sofia. This gentleman and I have a few matters to discuss—before I give him the drubbing of a lifetime.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The drubbing of a lifetime? But Viktor Stepanovich is my instructor.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Keeping one eye on the scoundrel, the Count glanced at his daughter with the other. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Your what?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“My instructor. He is teaching me piano.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The so-called instructor nodded four times in quick succession. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Without releasing his hold on the cad’s lapels, the Count leaned his head back so that he could study the  <i class="calibre3">mise-en-scène</i> with a little more care. Upon closer inspection, the loveseat the two had been sitting on did, in fact, appear to be the bench of a piano. And in the spot where their hands had been intertwined there was an orderly row of ivory keys. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The Count tightened his grip. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“So that’s your game, is it? Seducing young women with jitterbugs?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The so-called instructor looked aghast. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Absolutely not, Your Excellency. I have never seduced a soul with a jitterbug. We have been playing scales and sonatas. I myself trained at the Conservatory—where I received the Mussorgsky Medal. I only conduct in the restaurant in order to make ends meet.” Taking advantage of the Count’s hesitation, he gestured toward the piano with his head. “Let us show you. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Sofia, why don’t you play the nocturne that we have been practicing?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The nocturne . . . ? </p>
<p class="calibre1">“As you wish, Viktor Stepanovich,” Sofia replied politely, then turned to the keyboard in order to arrange her sheet music. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p320"></a>“Perhaps . . . ,” the instructor said to the Count with another nod toward the piano. “If I could just . . .” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh,” said the Count. “Yes, of course.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The Count set him back on the ground and gave his lapels a quick brushing. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Then the instructor joined his student on the bench. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“All right, Sofia.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Straightening her posture, Sofia laid her fingers on the keys; then with the utmost delicacy, she began to play. </p>
<p class="calibre1">At the sound of the first measure, the Count took two steps back. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Were those eight notes familiar to him? Did he recognize them in the least? Why, he would have known them if he hadn’t seen them in thirty years and they happened to enter his compartment on a train. He would have known them if he bumped into them on the streets of Florence at the height of the season. In a word, he would have known them anywhere. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It was Chopin. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Opus 9, number 2, in E-flat major. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As she completed the first iteration of the melody in a perfect pianissimo and transitioned to the second with its suggestion of rising emotional force, the Count took another two steps back and found himself sitting in a chair. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Had he felt pride in Sofia before? Of course he had. On a daily basis. He was proud of her success in school, of her beauty, of her composure, of the fondness with which she was regarded by all who worked in the hotel. And that is how he could be certain that what he was experiencing at that moment could not be referred to as pride. For there is something knowing in the state of pride.  <i class="calibre3">Look</i>, it says,  <i class="calibre3">didn’t I tell you how special she is? How</i> <i class="calibre3">bright? How lovely? Well, now you can see it for yourself. </i> But in listening to Sofia play Chopin, the Count had left the realm of knowing and entered the realm of astonishment. </p>
<p class="calibre1">On one level he was astonished by the revelation that Sofia could play the piano at all; on another, that she tackled the primary and subordinate melodies with such skill. But what was truly astonishing was the sensitivity of her musical expression. One could spend a lifetime mastering the technical aspects of the piano and never achieve a state of musical expression—that alchemy by which the performer not only comprehends</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p321"></a><img class="calibre2" src="index-321_1.jpg"/></p>
<p class="calibre1">the sentiments of the composer, but somehow communicates them to her audience through the manner of her play. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Whatever personal sense of heartache Chopin had hoped to express through this little composition—whether it had been prompted by a loss of love, or simply the sweet anguish one feels when witnessing a mist on a meadow in the morning—it was right there, ready to be experienced to its fullest, in the ballroom of the Hotel Metropol one hundred years after the composer’s death. But how, the question remained, could a seventeen-year-old girl achieve this feat of expression, if not by channeling a sense of loss and longing of her own? </p>
<p class="calibre1">As Sofia began the third iteration of the melody, Viktor Stepanovich looked over his shoulder with his eyebrows raised, as if to say:  <i class="calibre3">Can you</i> <i class="calibre3">believe it? </i> <i class="calibre3">Have you ever in all your years even imagined? </i> Then he quickly looked back to the piano and dutifully turned the page for Sofia almost in the manner of an apprentice turning the page for his master. </p>
<p class="calibre1">After the Count had led Viktor Stepanovich into the hall, where they could confer for a moment in private, he returned to the ballroom. Finding Sofia still at the piano, he took a seat at her side with his back to the keys. </p>
<p class="calibre1">They were both silent. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Why didn’t you tell me you were studying piano?” the Count asked after a moment. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I wanted it to be a surprise,” she said. “For your birthday. I didn’t mean to upset you. I’m so sorry if I did.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Sofia, if anyone should be apologizing, it should be me. You have done nothing wrong. On the contrary. That was wonderful—and unambiguously so.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Sofia blushed and looked down at the keyboard. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It is a lovely composition,” she said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well, yes,” agreed the Count with a laugh, “it is a lovely composition. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But it is also a piece of paper with circles, lines, and dots. Nearly every student of piano for a century has learned to play that little bit of Chopin. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But for most of them, it is an act of recitation. Only one in a thousand—or even a hundred thousand—can bring the music to life as you just have.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p322"></a>Sofia continued to look at the keyboard. The Count hesitated. And then with a touch of trepidation, he asked:</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Is everything all right?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Sofia looked up, a little surprised. Then seeing how grave her father’s expression was, she smiled. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Of course, Papa. Why do you ask?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The Count shook his head. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’ve never played an instrument in my life, but I understand something of music. To have played the opening measures of that piece with feelings so perfectly evocative of heartache, one can only assume that you have drawn on some wellspring of sorrow within yourself.” </p>

<p class="calibre1">The Count was quiet, overwhelmed by another wave of astonishment. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Does that make sense?” Sofia asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Abundantly,” he said. Then after a moment of reflection, he added: “As a younger man, I used to feel the same way about my sister. Every year that passed, it seemed a little more of her had slipped away; and I began to fear that one day I would come to forget her altogether. But the truth is: No matter how much time passes, those we have loved never slip away from us entirely.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">They were both quiet now. Then looking about him, the Count gestured with his hand. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“This was a favorite room of hers.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Of your sister’s?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No, no. Of your mother’s.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Sofia looked around with some surprise. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The ballroom . . . ?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Most definitely. After the Revolution, all the old ways of doing things were abandoned—which was the point, I suppose. But the new ways of doing things had yet to be established. So all across Russia, all manner of</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p323"></a><img class="calibre2" src="index-323_1.jpg"/></p>
<p class="calibre1">groups—trade unions, citizens’ committees, commissariats—gathered in rooms like this one in order to hash things out.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The Count pointed to the balcony. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“When your mother was nine, she would crouch up there behind the balustrade to watch these Assemblies for hours on end. She found it all very thrilling. The shuffling of chairs and the heartfelt speeches and the pounding of the gavel. And in retrospect, she was perfectly right. After all, a new course for the country was being charted right before our eyes. But at the time, what with the crawling and the hunching, it just gave me a crick in the neck.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You would go up there too?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh, she insisted.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The Count and Sofia both smiled. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Come to think of it,” added the Count after a moment, “that’s how I came to know your Aunt Marina. Because every other visit to the balcony, I’d split the seat of my pants.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Sofia laughed. Then the Count wagged a finger in the manner of one who has remembered something else. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Later, when your mother was thirteen or fourteen, she would come here to enact experiments . . .” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Experiments!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Your mother was not one to take anything on faith. If she hadn’t witnessed a phenomenon with her own eyes, then as far as she was concerned it was a hypothesis. And that included all the laws of physics and mathematics. One day, I found her here testing the principles of Galileo and Newton by dropping various objects from the balcony and timing their descent with a sprinter’s watch.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Is that even possible?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It was for your mother.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">They were quiet for another moment, then Sofia turned and kissed the Count on the cheek. </p>
<p class="calibre1">When Sofia had gone off to meet a friend, the Count went to the Piazza and treated himself to a glass of wine with lunch—something that he had done</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p324"></a>on a daily basis in his thirties and had rarely done since. Given the morning’s revelations, it seemed only appropriate. In fact, when his plate had been cleared and he had dutifully declined dessert, he ordered a second glass. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As he leaned back with his wine in hand, he regarded the young man at the neighboring table, who was sketching in his sketchbook. The Count had noticed him in the lobby the day before with the book in his lap and a small tin of colored pencils at his side. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The Count leaned a little to his right. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Landscape, portrait, or still life?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The young man looked up with a touch of surprise. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Excuse me?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I couldn’t help but notice you sketching away. I was just wondering if it was a landscape, a portrait, or a still life.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“None of the above, I’m afraid,” the young man replied politely. “It is an interior.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Of the restaurant?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“May I see?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The young man hesitated then handed the Count his book. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As soon as the Count had it in hand, he regretted his reference to <i class="calibre3">sketching</i>. The word hardly did justice to the young man’s skills as an artist, for he had captured the Piazza perfectly. The guests at the tables were rendered with the short, bright strokes of Impressionism, adding to the sense that they were engaged in lively conversations; while the waiters moving deftly between the tables were rendered in something of a blur. But the suggestive style with which the young man had drawn the people was sharply contrasted by the level of detail with which he had drawn the room itself. The columns, the fountain, the arches were all realized in perfect perspective to perfect proportion, with every ornament in place. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It’s a wonderful drawing,” said the Count. “But I must say, your sense of space is particularly exquisite.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The stranger smiled a little wistfully. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That’s because I’m an architect by training, not an artist.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Are you designing a hotel?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The architect gave a laugh. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p325"></a>“The way things stand, I’d be happy to design a birdhouse.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Given the Count’s expression of curiosity, the young man elaborated:</p>
<p class="calibre1">“For the time being, there are a lot of buildings being built in Moscow, but little need for architects. So I have taken a job with Intourist. They’re putting together a brochure of the city’s finer hotels and I’m drawing the</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a href="index_split_006.html#p464">interiors.”*</a></p>
<p class="calibre1">“Ah,” said the Count. “Because a photograph cannot capture the  <i class="calibre3">feeling</i> of a place!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Actually,” replied the architect, “because a photograph too readily captures the  <i class="calibre3">condition</i> of a place.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh, I see,” said the Count, feeling a little insulted on the Piazza’s behalf. In its defense, he couldn’t help pointing out that while the restaurant had been celebrated for its elegance in its time, the room’s grandeur had never been defined by its furnishings or architectural details. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“By what then?” the young man asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The citizenry.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“How do you mean?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The Count turned his chair so that he could better face his neighbor. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“In my day, I had the luxury of doing a good bit of travel. And I can tell you from personal experience that the majority of hotel restaurants—not simply in Russia, you understand, but across Europe—were designed for and have served the guests of the hotel. But this restaurant wasn’t and hasn’t. It was designed to be and has been a gathering place for the entire city of Moscow.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The Count gestured toward the center of the room. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“For most of the last forty years, on a typical Saturday night you could find Russians cut from every cloth crowded around that fountain, stumbling into conversations with whosoever happened to be at the neighboring table. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Naturally, this has led to impromptu romances and heartfelt debates on the merits of Pushkin over Petrarch. Why, I’ve watched cabbies rub elbows with commisars and bishops with black marketeers; and on at least one occasion, I have actually seen a young lady change an old man’s point of view.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The Count pointed to a spot about twenty feet away. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You see those two tables there? One afternoon in 1939 I watched as two strangers, finding each other vaguely familiar, spent their appetizer, </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p326"></a><img class="calibre2" src="index-326_1.jpg"/></p>
<p class="calibre1">entrée, and dessert going over their entire lives step by step in search of the moment when they must have met.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Looking around the restaurant with renewed appreciation, the architect observed:</p>
<p class="calibre1">“I suppose a room is the summation of all that has happened inside it.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes, I think it is,” agreed the Count. “And though I’m not exactly sure what has come of all the intermingling in this particular room, I am fairly certain that the world has been a better place because of it.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The Count was quiet for a moment as he too looked around. Then pointing a finger, he directed the architect’s attention to the bandstand on the far side of the room. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Have you ever happened to see the orchestra play here in the evening?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No, I haven’t. Why?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The most extraordinary thing happened to me today. . . .” </p>

<p class="calibre1">“No!” exclaimed Richard Vanderwhile. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Naturally, the fellow asked where she was studying. He was taken aback to learn that she hadn’t been studying with anyone. She had taught herself to play the piece by listening to one of the recordings you had given me and then sounding out the notes one by one.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Incredible.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The fellow was so impressed with her natural abilities that he took her on as a student right then and there; and he has been teaching her the classical repertoire in the ballroom ever since.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“And this is the chap from the Piazza, you say?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“None other.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The one who waves the baton?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The very same.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Richard shook his head in wonder. “Audrius, have you heard all of this? </p>
<p class="calibre1">We’ve got to raise a glass to the young lady, and as soon as possible. Two Goldenrods, my good man.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p327"></a>The ever-attentive tender at bar was already lining up bottles of various sizes including yellow chartreuse, bitters, honey, and a vodka infused with lemon. On that night in 1946 when the Count and Richard had first become acquainted over Audrius’s magenta concoction, the American had challenged the bartender to design a cocktail in each of the colors of St. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Basil’s Cathedral. Thus were born the Goldenrod, the Robin’s Egg, the Brick Wall, and a dark green potion called the Christmas Tree. In addition, it had become generally known in the bar that anyone who could drink all four cocktails back to back earned the right to be called “The Patriarch of All Russia”—as soon as he regained consciousness. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Though Richard, who was now attached to the State Department, tended to stay at the embassy when in Moscow, he would still stop by the Metropol on occasion in order to have a nightcap with the Count. Thus, the Goldenrods were poured and the two gentlemen clinked their glasses with the toast: “To old friends.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Some might wonder that the two men should consider themselves to be old friends having only known each other for four years; but the tenure of friendships has never been governed by the passage of time. These two would have felt like old friends had they met just hours before. To some degree, this was because they were kindred spirits—finding ample evidence of common ground and cause for laughter in the midst of effortless conversation; but it was also almost certainly a matter of upbringing. Raised in grand homes in cosmopolitan cities, educated in the liberal arts, graced with idle hours, and exposed to the finest things, though the Count and the American had been born ten years and four thousand miles apart, they had more in common with each other than they had with the majority of their own countrymen. </p>
<p class="calibre1">This, of course, is why the grand hotels of the world’s capitals all look alike. The Plaza in New York, the Ritz in Paris, Claridge’s in London, the Metropol in Moscow—built within fifteen years of each other, they too were kindred spirits, the first hotels in their cities with central heating, with hot water and telephones in the rooms, with international newspapers in the lobbies, international cuisine in the restaurants, and American bars off the lobby. These hotels were built for the likes of Richard Vanderwhile and Alexander Rostov, so that when they traveled to a foreign city, they would find themselves very much at home and in the company of kin. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p328"></a>“I still can’t believe it’s that fellow from the Piazza,” said Richard with another shake of the head. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I know,” said the Count. “But he actually studied at the Conservatory here in Moscow where he was the recipient of the Mussorgsky Medal. He only conducts at the Piazza in order to make ends meet.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“One must make ends meet,” confirmed Audrius matter-of-factly, “or meet one’s end.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Richard studied the bartender for a moment. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well, that’s the very essence of it, isn’t it?” </p>

<p class="calibre1">“Are you familiar with the moths of Manchester?” he asked Richard. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The moths of Manchester . . . Isn’t that a soccer team?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No,” said the Count with a smile. “It is not a soccer team. It is an extraordinary case from the annals of the natural sciences that my father related to me as a child.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">But before the Count could elaborate, Audrius returned. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That was your wife on the phone, Mr. Vanderwhile. She asked me to remind you of your appointment in the morning; and to alert you that your driver is waiting outside.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Though most of the customers in the bar had never met Mrs. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Vanderwhile, she was known to be as unflappable as Arkady, as attentive as Audrius, and as aware of whereabouts as Vasily—when it came to drawing Mr. Vanderwhile’s evenings to a close. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Ah, yes,” conceded Mr. Vanderwhile. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Agreeing that duty comes first, the Count and Mr. Vanderwhile shook hands and wished each other well till next they met. </p>

<p class="calibre1">He too, thought the Count, is one of the moths of Manchester <i class="calibre3">. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">When the Count was nine years old, his father had sat him down in order to explain Darwin’s theory of natural selection. As the Count listened, </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p329"></a>the essence of the Englishman’s idea seemed perfectly intuitive—that over tens of thousands of years a species would slowly evolve in order to maximize its chances of survival. After all, if the claws of the lion grow sharper, the gazelle had best grow more fleet of foot. But what had disconcerted the Count was when his father clarified that natural selection didn’t need tens of thousands of years to take place. It didn’t even need a hundred. It had been observed unfolding over the course of a few decades. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It was true, his father said, that in a relatively static environment the pace of evolution should decelerate, as individual species have little new to adapt to. But environments are never static for long. The forces of nature inevitably unleash themselves in such a manner that the necessity for adaptation will be stirred. An extended drought, an unusually cold winter, a volcanic eruption, any one of these could alter the balance between those traits that improve a species’ chance for survival and those that hinder it. In essence, this is what had occurred in Manchester, England, in the nineteenth century, when the city became one of the first capitals of the industrial revolution. </p>
<p class="calibre1">For thousands of years, the peppered moths of Manchester had white wings with black flecking. This coloring provided the species with perfect camouflage whenever they landed on the light gray bark of the region’s trees. In any generation there might be a few aberrations—such as moths with pitch-black wings—but they were snapped off the trees by the birds before they had a chance to mate. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But when Manchester became crowded with factories in the early 1800s, the soot from the smokestacks began to settle on every conceivable surface, including the bark of the trees; and the lightly speckled wings that had served to protect the majority of peppered moths suddenly exposed them remorselessly to their predators—even as the darker wings of the aberrations rendered them invisible. Thus, the pitch-black varieties that had represented less than 10 percent of the Manchester moth population in 1800, represented over 90 percent by the end of the century. Or so explained the Count’s father, with the pragmatic satisfaction of the scientifically minded. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But the lesson did not sit well with the young Count. If this could happen so easily to moths, he thought, then what was to stop it from happening to children? What would happen to him and his sister, for</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p330"></a><img class="calibre2" src="index-330_1.jpg"/></p>
<p class="calibre1">instance, should they be exposed to excess chimney smoke or sudden extremes of weather? Couldn’t they become victims of accelerated evolution? In fact, so disconcerted by this notion became the Count that when Idlehour was deluged by rainstorms that September, giant black moths harrowed his dreams. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Some years later, the Count would come to understand that he had been looking at the matter upside down. The pace of evolution was not something to be frightened by. For while nature doesn’t have a stake in whether the wings of a peppered moth are black or white, it genuinely hopes that the peppered moth will persist. And that is why nature designed the forces of evolution to play out over generations rather than eons—to ensure that moths and men have a chance to adapt. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Like Viktor Stepanovich, the Count reflected. A husband and father of two, he must make ends meet. So he waves his baton in the Piazza, ostensibly putting the classical repertoire behind him. Then one afternoon, when he happens to stumble upon a young pianist with promise, in what little time he has to spare, he teaches her the nocturnes of Chopin on a borrowed piano. Just so, Mishka has his “project”; and this young architect, unable to build buildings, takes pride and pleasure from the careful drafting of hotel interiors in his sketchbook. </p>
<p class="calibre1">For a moment, the Count considered going over to the young man, but he seemed to be applying his skills with such satisfaction that it would be a crime to interrupt him. So, instead, the Count emptied his glass, tapped the bar twice, and headed upstairs for bed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Of course, the Count was perfectly right. For when life makes it impossible for a man to pursue his dreams, he will connive to pursue them anyway. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Thus, even as the Count was brushing his teeth, Viktor Stepanovich was setting aside an arrangement that he had been working on for his orchestra in order to sort through the Goldberg Variations—in search of one that might be just right for Sofia. While in the village of Yavas, in a rented room not much larger than the Count’s, by the light of a candle, Mikhail Mindich was sitting hunched over a table, sewing another signature of sixteen pages. </p>
<p class="calibre1">And down in the Shalyapin? The young architect continued to take pride</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p331"></a>and pleasure in his work. But contrary to the Count’s supposition, he was not adding a rendering of the bar to his collection of hotel interiors. In fact, he was working in a different sketchbook altogether. </p>
<p class="calibre1">On the first of this book’s many pages was the design for a skyscraper two hundred stories tall—with a diving board on the roof from which the tenants could parachute to a grassy park below. On another page was a cathedral to atheism with fifty different cupolas, several of which could be launched like rockets to the moon. And on another was a giant museum of architecture showcasing life-size replicas of all the grand old buildings that had been razed in the city of Moscow to make way for the new. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But at this particular moment, what the architect was working on was a detailed drawing of a crowded restaurant that looked very much like the Piazza. Only, under the floor of this restaurant was an elaborate mechanics of axles, cogs, and gears; and jutting from an outside wall was a giant crank, at the turn of which, each of the restaurant’s chairs would pirouette like a ballerina on a music box, then spin around the space until they came to a stop at an entirely different table. And towering over this tableau, peering down through the glass ceiling, was a gentleman of sixty with his hand on the crank, preparing to set the diners in motion. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p332"></a><b class="calibre4">1952</b></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3"><b class="calibre4">America</b></i></p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre4">O</b>n a Wednesday evening in late June, the Count and Sofia walked arm in arm into the Boyarsky, where it was their custom to dine on the Count’s night off. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Good evening, Andrey.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“<i class="calibre3">Bonsoir, mon ami. Bonsoir, mademoiselle</i>. Your table awaits.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">As Andrey ushered them into the dining room with a gesture of his hand, the Count could see it was another busy night. On the way to table ten, they passed the wives of two commissars seated at table four. Dining alone at table six was an eminent professor of literature—who they say had single-handedly wrestled the works of Dostoevsky to the ground. And at table seven was none other than the beguiling Anna Urbanova in the company of the beguiled. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Having successfully returned to the silver screen in the 1930s, in 1948</p>
<p class="calibre1">Anna had been lured back to the stage by the director of the Maly Theatre. </p>
<p class="calibre1">This was a stroke of good fortune for the fifty-year-old actress, for while the silver screen showed a distinct preference for young beauties, the theater seemed to understand the virtues of age. After all, Medea, Lady Macbeth, Irina Arkadina—these were not roles for the blue-eyed and blushing. They were roles for women who had known the bitterness of joy and the sweetness of despair. But Anna’s return to the stage also proved fortunate for the Count because instead of visiting the Metropol a few days a year, she was now in residence for months at a time, which allowed our seasoned astronomer to chart the newest of her constellations with the utmost care. . . . </p>
<p class="calibre1">Once the Count and Sofia had been seated, the two carefully studied their menus (working backward from entrées to appetizers as was their</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p333"></a>custom), placed their orders with Martyn (who, at the Count’s recommendation, had been promoted to the Boyarsky in 1942), and then finally turned their attention to the business at hand. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Surely, the span of time between the placing of an order and the arrival of appetizers is one of the most perilous in all human interaction. What young lovers have not found themselves at this juncture in a silence so sudden, so seemingly insurmountable that it threatens to cast doubt upon their chemistry as a couple? What husband and wife have not found themselves suddenly unnerved by the fear that they might not ever have something urgent, impassioned, or surprising to say to each other again? So it is with good reason that most of us meet this dangerous interstice with a sense of foreboding. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But the Count and Sofia? They looked forward to it all day long—</p>
<p class="calibre1">because it was the moment allotted for  <i class="calibre3">Zut. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">A game of their own invention,  <i class="calibre3">Zut</i>’s rules were simple. Player One proposes a category encompassing a specialized subset of phenomena—</p>
<p class="calibre1">such as stringed instruments, or famous islands, or winged creatures other than birds. The two players then go back and forth until one of them fails to come up with a fitting example in a suitable interval of time (say, two and a half minutes). Victory goes to the first player who wins two out of three rounds. And why was the game called  <i class="calibre3">Zut</i>? Because according to the Count, <i class="calibre3">Zut alors! </i> was the only appropriate exclamation in the face of defeat. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Thus, having searched throughout their day for challenging categories and carefully considered the viable responses, when Martyn reclaimed the menus father and daughter faced each other at the ready. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Having lost the previous match, the Count had the right to propose the first category and did so with confidence: “Famous foursomes.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well chosen,” said Sofia. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Thank you.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">They both took a drink of water, then the Count began. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The four seasons.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The four elements.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“North, South, East, and West.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Diamonds, clubs, hearts, and spades.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Bass, tenor, alto, and soprano.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Sofia reflected. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p334"></a>. . . </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John—the Four Evangelists.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Boreas, Zephyrus, Notos, and Euros—the Four Winds.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">. . . </p>
<p class="calibre1">. . . </p>
<p class="calibre1">With an inward smile, the Count began counting the seconds; but he counted prematurely. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yellow bile, black bile, blood, and phlegm—the Four Humors,” said Sofia. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“<i class="calibre3">Très bien! </i>” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“<i class="calibre3">Merci</i>.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Sofia took a sip of water in order to obscure the hint of gloating on her lips. But now it was she who was celebrating prematurely. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Ah,” said Sofia with the sigh of one receiving the  <i class="calibre3">coup de grâce</i>, just as Martyn arrived with the Château d’Yquem. Having presented the bottle, the waiter pulled the cork, poured a taste, and served the table. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Round two?” asked Sofia when Martyn had departed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“With pleasure.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Animals that are black and white—such as the zebra.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Excellent,” said the Count. </p>
<p class="calibre1">For a moment, he rearranged his silverware. He took a sip of wine and slowly returned his glass to the table. </p>

<p class="calibre1">“Puffin.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Skunk.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Panda.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The Count reflected; then smiled. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Killer whale.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The peppered moth,” countered Sofia. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The Count sat up in indignation. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But that’s  <i class="calibre3">my</i> animal!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It is not your animal; but it is your turn. . . .” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The Count frowned. </p>
<p class="calibre1">. . . </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Dalmatian!” he exclaimed. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p335"></a>Now it was Sofia who arranged her silver and sipped her wine. </p>
<p class="calibre1">. . . </p>
<p class="calibre1">. . . </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Time is passing . . . ,” said the Count. </p>
<p class="calibre1">. . . </p>
<p class="calibre1">. . . </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Me,” said Sofia. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">With a tilt of her head she held out the white stripe from her long black hair. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But you’re not an animal.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Sofia smiled sympathetically then said: “You’re up.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">. . . </p>
<p class="calibre1">. . . </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">Is there a black-and-white fish? </i> the Count asked himself.  <i class="calibre3">A black-and-white spider? A black-and-white snake? </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">. . . </p>
<p class="calibre1">. . . </p>

<p class="calibre1">“Yes, yes. Wait a moment.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">. . . </p>
<p class="calibre1">. . . </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">I know there is another black-and-white animal</i>, thought the Count.  <i class="calibre3">It is</i> <i class="calibre3">something reasonably common. I’ve seen it myself. It’s on the very tip of my</i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">—</i></p>
<p class="calibre1">“Do I have the pleasure of addressing Alexander Rostov?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The Count and Sofia both looked up in surprise. Standing before them was the eminent professor from table six. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes,” said the Count, rising from the table. “I am Alexander Rostov. </p>
<p class="calibre1">This is my daughter, Sofia.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I am Professor Matej Sirovich from Leningrad State University.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Of course you are,” said the Count. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The professor gave a quick bow of the head in gratitude. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Like so many others,” he continued, “I am an admirer of your verse. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Perhaps you would do me the honor of joining me for a glass of cognac after your meal?” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p336"></a>“It would be my pleasure.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I am in suite 317.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I will be there within the hour.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Please, don’t rush.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The professor smiled and gently backed away from the table. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Resuming his seat, the Count casually placed his napkin in his lap. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Matej Sirovich,” he informed Sofia, “is one of our most revered professors of literature; and apparently, he would like to discuss poetry with me over a glass of cognac. What do you think of that?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I think your time is up.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The Count lowered his eyebrows. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes. Well. I had an answer sitting right on the tip of my tongue. I should have expressed it in another moment, if we hadn’t been interrupted. . . .” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Sofia nodded, in the friendly manner of one who has no intention of considering the merits of an appeal. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“All right,” conceded the Count. “One round apiece.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The Count took a kopek from the ticket pocket of his vest and laid it on his thumbnail so that they could determine by toss who would get to choose the tie-breaking category. But before he could flip the coin, Martyn appeared with their first course: Emile’s interpretation of the Olivier salad for Sofia and goose-liver pâté for the Count. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Since they never played while they ate, the two turned their attention to an enjoyable discussion of the day’s events. It was while the Count was spreading the last of his pâté on a corner of toast that Sofia observed, rather casually, that Anna Urbanova was in the restaurant. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What’s that?” asked the Count. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Anna Urbanova, the actress. She’s seated over there at table seven.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Is she?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The Count raised his head to look across the dining room with the curiosity of the idle; then returned to his spreading. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Why don’t you ever invite her to join us for dinner?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The Count looked up with an expression of mild shock. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Invite her to dinner! Shall I invite Charlie Chaplin as well?” The Count gave a laugh and a shake of the head: “It is customary to be acquainted with</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p337"></a>someone before you invite them to dinner, my dear.” Then he finished off the pâté, just as he had finished off the conversation. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I think you’re worried that I would be scandalized in some way,” </p>
<p class="calibre1">continued Sofia. “But Marina thinks it’s because—” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Marina!” exclaimed the Count. “Marina has an opinion on why I would or wouldn’t invite this . . . this Anna Urbanova to dine with us?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Naturally, Papa.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The Count leaned back in his chair. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I see. So what is this opinion that Marina so  <i class="calibre3">naturally</i> has?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“She thinks it’s because you like to keep your buttons in their boxes.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“My buttons in their boxes!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You know: your blue buttons in one box, your black buttons in another, your red buttons in a third. You have your relationships here, your relationships there, and you like to keep them distinct.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Is that so. I had no idea that I was known to treat people like buttons.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Not all people, Papa. Just your friends.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What a relief.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“May I?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">It was Martyn, gesturing at the empty plates. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Thank you,” snapped the Count. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Sensing that he had interrupted a heated exchange, Martyn quickly cleared the first course, returned with two servings of veal Pojarski, topped up the wine glasses, and disappeared without a word. The Count and Sofia both breathed in the woody fragrance of the mushrooms then began to eat in silence. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Emile has outdone himself,” the Count said after a few bites. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“He has,” Sofia agreed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The Count took a generous swallow of the Château d’Yquem, which was a 1921 and perfectly suited to the veal. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Anna thinks it’s because you’re set in your ways.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The Count commenced to cough into his napkin, as he had determined long ago that this was the most effective means of removing wine from his windpipe. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Are you all right?” asked Sofia. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The Count put his napkin in his lap and waved a hand in the general direction of table seven. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p338"></a><img class="calibre2" src="index-338_1.jpg"/></p>
<p class="calibre1">“And how, may I ask, do you know what this Anna Urbanova thinks?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Because she told me so.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“So the two of you are acquainted.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But, of course we are. We have known each other for years.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well, that’s just perfect,” said the Count in a huff. “Why don’t  <i class="calibre3">you</i> invite her to dinner. In fact, if I am such a button in a box, perhaps you, Marina, and Miss Urbanova should all have dinner on your own.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Why, that’s exactly what Andrey suggested!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“How is everything tonight?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Speak of the devil!” shouted the Count as he dumped his napkin on his plate. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Taken aback, Andrey looked from the Count to Sofia with concern. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Is something wrong?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The food at the Boyarsky is superior,” replied the Count, “and the service is excellent. But the gossip? It is truly unsurpassed.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The Count stood. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I think you have some piano practice to see to, young lady,” he said to Sofia. “Now if you’ll both excuse me, I am expected upstairs.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">As the Count marched down the hallway, he could not help but observe to himself that there was a time, not long before, when a gentleman could expect a measure of privacy in his personal affairs. With reasonable confidence, he could place his correspondence in a desk drawer and leave his diary on a bedside table. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Although, on the other hand, since the beginning of time men in pursuit of wisdom had routinely retreated to mountaintops, caves, and cabins in the woods. So, perhaps that is where one must eventually head, if one has any hopes of achieving enlightenment without the interference of meddlers. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Case in point: As the Count headed for the stairwell, who did he happen to bump into waiting for an elevator? None other than that renowned expert on human behavior, Anna Urbanova. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Good evening, Your Excellency . . .” she said to the Count with a suggestive smile. But then her eyebrows rose in inquiry when she noted the expression on his face. “Is everything all right?” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p339"></a><img class="calibre2" src="index-339_1.jpg"/></p>
<p class="calibre1">“I can’t believe that you have been having clandestine conversations with Sofia,” the Count said in a hushed voice, though no one else was about. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“They weren’t clandestine,” Anna whispered back. “They just happened to be while you were at work.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“And you think that is somehow appropriate? To foster a friendship with my daughter in my absence?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well, you do like your buttons in their boxes, Sasha. . . .” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“So I gather!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The Count turned to go, but then came back. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“And if, perchance, I do like my buttons in their boxes, is there anything wrong with that?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Certainly not.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Would the world be a better place if we kept all the buttons in a big glass jar? In such a world, whenever you tried to reach in for a button of a particular color, the tips of your fingers would inevitably push it down below the other buttons until you couldn’t see it. Eventually, in a state of exasperation, you would end up pouring all of the buttons on the floor—and then spend an hour and a half having to pick them back up.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Are we talking about actual buttons now?” asked Anna with genuine interest. “Or is this still an allegory?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What is not an allegory,” said the Count, “is my appointment with an eminent professor. Which, by the way, will necessitate the cancellation of any further appointments for the evening!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ten minutes later, the Count was knocking on that door which he had answered a thousand times, but upon which he had never knocked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Ah, here you are,” said the professor. “Please come in.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The Count had not been in his old suite in over twenty-five years—not since that night in 1926 when he had stood at the parapet. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Still styled in the manner of a nineteenth-century French salon, the rooms remained elegant, if a little worse for wear. Only one of the two gilded mirrors now hung on the wall; the dark red curtains had faded; the matching couch and chairs needed to be reupholstered; and while his</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p340"></a>family’s clock still stood guard near the door, its hands were stopped at 4:22</p>
<p class="calibre1">—having become an aspect of the room’s décor, rather than an essential instrument for the keeping of engagements. But if one no longer heard the gentle sound of time advancing in the suite, in its place were the strains of a waltz emanating from an electric radio on the dining room mantel. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Following the professor into the sitting room, the Count habitually glanced at the northwest corner with its privileged view of the Bolshoi—</p>

<p class="calibre1">“Alexander!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">. . . </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Richard?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">It was none other. Dressed in a tailored suit, Richard Vanderwhile smiled and took hold of the Count’s hand. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It’s good to see you! How long has it been? Almost two years?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">From the dining room, the strains of the waltz grew a little louder. The Count looked over just in time to see Professor Sirovich closing the doors to his bedroom and turning the brass latch. Richard gestured to one of the chairs by the coffee table, on which was an assortment of zakuski. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Have a seat. I gather you’ve eaten, but you won’t mind if I dig in, will you? I’m absolutely starving.” Sitting on the couch, Richard put a slice of smoked salmon on a piece of bread and chewed it with relish even as he spread caviar on a blini. “I saw Sofia from across the lobby this afternoon and I couldn’t believe my eyes. What a beauty she’s become! You must have all the boys in Moscow knocking at your door.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Richard,” said the Count with a wave at the room, “what are we doing here?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Richard nodded, brushing the crumbs from his hands. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I apologize for the theatrics. Professor Sirovich is an old friend, and generous enough to loan me his sitting room on occasion. I’m only in town for a few days, and I didn’t want to miss the opportunity to speak with you in private, as I’m not exactly sure when I’ll be back.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Has something happened?” the Count asked with concern. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Richard put up both hands. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p341"></a>“Not at all. In fact, they tell me it’s a promotion. I’ll be working out of the embassy in Paris for the next few years overseeing a little initiative of ours, which is likely to keep me tied to a desk. Actually, Alexander, that’s why I wanted to see you. . . .” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Richard sat a little forward on the couch, putting his elbows on his knees. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Since the war, relations between our countries may not have been especially chummy, but they have been predictable. We launch the Marshall Plan, you launch the Molotov Plan. We form NATO; you form the Cominform. We develop an atom bomb, you develop an atom bomb. It’s been like a game of tennis—which is not only a good form of exercise, but awfully entertaining to watch. Vodka?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Richard poured them both a glass. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“<i class="calibre3">Za vas</i>,” he said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“<i class="calibre3">Za vas</i>,” replied the Count. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The men emptied their glasses and Richard refilled them. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The problem is that your top player has played the game so well, for so long, he’s the only player we know. Were he to quit tomorrow, we’d have no idea which fellow would pick up his racket, and whether he’d play from the baseline or the net.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Richard paused. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You do play tennis?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’m afraid not.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Ah. Right. The point is, comrade Stalin appears to be on his last legs, and when he gives up his ghost, things are going to become very unpredictable. And not just in matters of international diplomacy. I mean right here in Moscow. Depending on who ends up in charge, the doors of the city could either be flung open to the world, or slammed shut and bolted from the inside.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We must hope for the former,” the Count declared. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Absolutely,” agreed Richard. “We certainly have no business praying for the latter. But whatever happens, it is preferable to anticipate. Which brings us to the point of my visit. You see, the group I’ll be heading in Paris is in the intelligence field. A sort of research unit, as it were. And we are looking for some friends here and there who might be in a position now and then to shed some light on this or that. . . .” </p>
