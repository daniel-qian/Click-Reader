<body><p class="calibre1">Yes, a ghost, thought the Count, as he moved silently down the hall. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Like Hamlet’s father roaming the ramparts of Elsinore after the midnight watch . . . Or like Akaky Akakievich, that forsaken spirit of Gogol’s who in the wee hours haunted the Kalinkin Bridge in search of his stolen coat . . . </p>
<p class="calibre1">Why is it that so many ghosts prefer to travel the halls of night? Ask the living and they will tell you that these spirits either have some unquenched desire or an unaddressed grievance that stirs them from their sleep and sends them out into the world in search of solace. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But the living are so self-centered. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Of course they would judge a spirit’s nocturnal wanderings as the product of earthly memories. When, in fact, if these restless souls wanted to harrow the bustling avenues of noon, there is nothing to stop them from doing so. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p124"></a><img class="calibre2" src="index-124_1.jpg"/></p>
<p class="calibre1">No. If they wander the halls of night, it is not from a grievance with or envy of the living. Rather, it is because they have no desire to see the living at all. Any more than snakes hope to see gardeners, or foxes the hounds. </p>
<p class="calibre1">They wander about at midnight because at that hour they can generally do so without being harried by the sound and fury of earthly emotions. After all those years of striving and struggling, of hoping and praying, of shouldering expectations, stomaching opinions, navigating decorum, and making conversation, what they seek, quite simply, is a little peace and quiet. At least, that is what the Count told himself as he drifted down the hall. </p>
<p class="calibre1">While, as a rule, the Count always took the stairs, when he approached the second-floor landing that night, on some ghostly whim he called for the elevator, assuming he would have it to himself. But when the doors slid open, there was the one-eyed cat. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Kutuzov!” he exclaimed in surprise. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Taking in every detail of the Count’s appearance, the cat responded exactly as the Grand Duke had responded under similar circumstances many years before—that is, with a stern look and a disappointed silence. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Ahem,” said the Count, as he stepped onto the elevator while trying to tuck in his shirt without dropping his shoes. </p>

<p class="calibre1">But as the Count was about to open the door to his rooms, on the back of his neck he felt a breath of air that was distinctly reminiscent of a summer breeze. Turning to his left, the Count stood motionless. There it was again, coming from the other end of the floor. . . . </p>
<p class="calibre1">Intrigued, the Count walked down the hall only to find that all the doors were tightly shut. At the hallway’s end, there seemed to be nothing but a confusion of pipes and flues. But in the farthest corner, in the shadow of the</p>

<p class="calibre1">The summer breeze that had beckoned the Count now wrapped him in its full embrace. Warm and forgiving, it called up feelings of summer nights from earlier in his life—from when he was five and ten and twenty on the streets of St. Petersburg or the pastures of Idlehour. Nearly overcome by the surge of old sentiments, he needed to pause a moment before continuing to the western edge of the roof. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Before him lay the ancient city of Moscow, which, after waiting patiently for two hundred years, was once again the seat of Russian governance. Despite the hour, the Kremlin shimmered with electric light from every window, as if its newest denizens were still too drunk with power to sleep. But if the lights of the Kremlin shimmered brightly, like all earthly lights before them they were diminished in their beauty by the majesty of the constellations overhead. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Craning his neck, the Count tried to identify the few that he had learned in his youth: Perseus, Orion, the Great Bear, each flawless and eternal. To what end, he wondered, had the Divine created the stars in heaven to fill a man with feelings of inspiration one day and insignificance the next? </p>
<p class="calibre1">Lowering his gaze to the horizon, the Count looked out beyond the limits of the city—to where that ancient comfort of sailors, the Morning Star, burned brightest in all the firmament. </p>
<p class="calibre1">And then blinked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Good morning, Your Excellency.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The Count spun about. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Standing a few feet behind him was a man in his early sixties wearing a canvas cap. When the man took a step forward, the Count recognized him as one of the handymen who battled the hotel’s leaky pipes and creaky doors. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That’s the Shukhov all right,” he said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The Shukhov?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The radio tower.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He pointed in the distance toward the comfort of sailors. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ah, thought the Count with a smile. Mishka’s spiraling structure of steel broadcasting the latest news and intelligence . . . </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p126"></a>The two men were silent for a moment, as if waiting for the beacon to blink again—which it reliably did. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well. The coffee’ll be ready. You might as well come along.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The old handyman led the Count to the northeast corner of the roof, where he had established something of a camp between two chimneys. In addition to a three-legged stool, there was a small fire burning in a brazier on which a coffeepot was steaming. The old man had chosen the spot well, for while it was out of the wind he still had a view of the Bolshoi that was only slightly impaired by some old crates stacked at the edge of the roof. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I don’t get many visitors,” the handyman said, “so I don’t have a second stool.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That’s quite all right,” said the Count, picking up a two-foot plank, setting it on end, and balancing himself on its edge. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Can I pour you a cup?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Thank you.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">As the coffee was being poured, the Count wondered whether this was the beginning or end of the old man’s day. Either way, he figured a cup of coffee would hit the spot. For what is more versatile? As at home in tin as it is in Limoges, coffee can energize the industrious at dawn, calm the reflective at noon, or raise the spirits of the beleagured in the middle of the night. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It’s perfect,” said the Count. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The old man leaned forward. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The secret is in the grinding.” He pointed to a little wooden apparatus with an iron crank. “Not a minute before you brew.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The Count raised his eyebrows with the appreciation of the uninitiated. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Yes, in the open air on a summer night the old man’s coffee was perfect. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In fact, the only thing that spoiled the moment was a humming in the air—</p>
<p class="calibre1">the sort that might be emitted from a faulty fuse or a radio receiver. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Is that the tower?” the Count asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Is what the tower?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The humming.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The old man looked up in the air for a moment then cackled. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That’ll be the boys at work.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The boys?” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p127"></a>The old man pointed with a thumb to the crates that compromised his view of the Bolshoi. In the predawn light, the Count could just make out a whirl of activity above them. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Are those . . . bees?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Indeed they are.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What are they doing here?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Making honey.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Honey!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The old man cackled again. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Making honey is what bees does. Here.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Leaning forward, the old man held out a roof tile on which there were two slices of black bread slathered with honey. The Count accepted one and took a bite. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The first thing that struck him was actually the black bread. For when was the last time he had even eaten it? If asked outright, he would have been embarrassed to admit. Tasting of dark rye and darker molasses, it was a perfect complement to a cup of coffee. And the honey? What an extraordinary contrast it provided. If the bread was somehow earthen, brown, and brooding, the honey was sunlit, golden, and gay. But there was another dimension to it. . . . An elusive, yet familiar element . . . A grace note hidden beneath, or behind, or within the sensation of sweetness. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What is that flavor . . . ?” the Count asked almost to himself. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The lilacs,” the old man replied. Without turning, he pointed with his thumb back in the direction of the Alexander Gardens. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Of course, thought the Count. That was it precisely. How could he have missed it? Why, there was a time when he knew the lilacs of the Alexander Gardens better than any man in Moscow. When the trees were in season, he could spend whole afternoons in happy repose under their white and purple blossoms. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“How extraordinary,” the Count said with an appreciative shake of the head. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It is and isn’t,” said the old man. “When the lilacs are in bloom, the bees’ll buzz to the Alexander Gardens and the honey’ll taste like the lilacs. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But in a week or so, they’ll be buzzing to the Garden Ring, and then you’ll be tasting the cherry trees.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The Garden Ring! How far will they go?” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p128"></a>“Some say a bee’ll cross the ocean for a flower,” answered the old man with a smile. “Though I’ve never known one to do so.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The Count shook his head, took another bite, and accepted a second cup of coffee. “As a boy, I spent a good deal of time in Nizhny Novgorod,” he recalled for the second time that day. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Where the apple blossoms fall like snow,” the old man said with a smile. “I was raised there myself. My father was the caretaker on the Chernik estate.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I know it well!” exclaimed the Count. “What a beautiful part of the world . . .” </p>
<p class="calibre1">So as the summer sun began to rise, the fire began to die, and the bees began to circle overhead, the two men spoke of days from their childhoods when the wagon wheels rattled in the road, and the dragonflies skimmed the grass, and the apple trees blossomed for as far as the eye could see. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p129"></a> <i class="calibre3"><b class="calibre4">Addendum</b></i></p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre4">A</b>t the very moment that the Count heard the door to suite 208 clicking shut, Anna Urbanova was, in fact, falling asleep; but she did not sleep soundly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">When the actress first dismissed the Count (having rolled onto her side with a languid sigh), she watched with cool pleasure as he gathered his clothes and drew the curtains. She even took some satisfaction when he paused to pick up her blouse and hang it in the closet. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But at some point during the night, this image of the Count picking up her blouse began to trouble her sleep. On the train back to St. Petersburg, she found herself muttering about it. And by the time she returned home, it positively infuriated her. In the week that followed, if she had the slightest break in her demanding schedule, the image rushed forth, and her famous alabaster cheeks grew red with rage. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Who does he think he is, this Count Rostov? Pulling out chairs and whistling at dogs? Putting on airs and looking down noses, is more like it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But by what right? Who gave him permission to pick up a blouse and hang it on its hanger? If I drop my blouse on the floor, what of it? It’s my clothing and I can treat it as I please!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Or so she would find herself reasoning to no one in particular. </p>
<p class="calibre1">One night, returning from a party, the very thought of the Count’s precious little gesture was so infuriating that when she undressed she not only threw her red silk gown on the floor, she instructed her staff that it was not to be touched. Each night that followed, she dumped another outfit on the floor. Dresses and blouses of velvet and silk from London and Paris, the more expensive the better. Dumped here on the bathroom floor and there by the dustbin. In a word, wherever it suited her. </p>
<p class="calibre1">After two weeks, her boudoir began to look like an Arabian tent with fabrics of every color underfoot. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p130"></a>Olga, the sixty-year-old Georgian who had met the Count at the door of suite 208 and who had faithfully served as the actress’s dresser since 1920, initially eyed her mistress’s behavior with seasoned indifference. But one night, when Anna had dropped a blue backless dress on top of a white silk gown, Olga observed matter-of-factly:</p>
<p class="calibre1">“My dear, you are acting like a child. If you do not pick up your clothes, I shall have no choice but to give you a spanking.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Anna Urbanova turned as red as a jar of jam. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Pick up my clothes?” she shouted. “You want me to pick up my clothes? Then I shall pick them up!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Gathering up twenty outfits in her arms, she marched to the open window and cast them into the street below. With the greatest satisfaction, the actress watched as they fluttered and coasted to the ground. When she wheeled about to confront her dresser in triumph, Olga coolly observed how entertained the neighbors would be by this evidence of the famous actress’s petulance, then she turned and left the room. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Switching off the lights and climbing into bed, Anna sputtered like a candle. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What do I care what the neighbors will say about my petulance. What do I care what St. Petersburg will say, or all of Russia!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">But at two in the morning, having tossed and turned, Anna Urbanova tiptoed down the grand staircase, slipped out into the street, and gathered up her garments one by one. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p131"></a><b class="calibre4">1924</b></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3"><b class="calibre4">Anonymity</b></i></p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre4">D</b>reams of invisibility are as old as folklore. By means of some talisman or potion, or with the help of the gods themselves, the corporeal presence of the hero is rendered insubstantial, and for the duration of the spell he may wander among his fellow men unseen. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The advantages of having such a power can be rattled off for you by any child of ten. Whether slipping past dragons, eavesdropping on intriguers, and sneaking into treasuries, or plucking a pie from the pantry, knocking the cap off a constable, and lighting the schoolmaster’s coattails on fire, suffice it to say that a thousand tales have been told in acknowledgment of invisibility’s bounty. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But the tale that has less often been told is the one in which the spell of invisibility is cast upon the unknowing hero in the form of a curse. Having lived his life in the heat of battle, at the crux of conversation, and in the twentieth row with its privileged view of the ladies in the loges—that is, in the very thick of things—suddenly, he finds himself invisible to friend and foe alike. And the spell that had been cast over the Count by Anna Urbanova in 1923 was of this very sort. </p>
<p class="calibre1">On that fateful night when the Count had dined with the enchantress in her suite, she presumably had the power to render him invisible on the spot. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Instead, to toy with his peace of mind, she had cast her spell to manifest itself over the course of a year, bit by bit. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In the weeks that followed, the Count suddenly noticed that he was disappearing from view for a few minutes at a time. He could be dining in the Piazza when a couple would approach his table with the clear intention of taking it as their own; or he could be standing near the front desk when a harried guest would nearly knock him off his feet. By winter, those prone to</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p132"></a>greet him with a wave or a smile often failed to see him until he was ten feet away. And now a year later? When he crossed the lobby, it often took a full minute for his closest friends to notice that he was standing right in front of them. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh,” said Vasily, returning the telephone receiver to its cradle. “Excuse me, Count Rostov. I didn’t see you there. How can I be of service?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The Count gave the concierge’s desk a delicate tap. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You wouldn’t happen to know where Nina is?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">In asking Vasily for Nina’s whereabouts, the Count was not making a passing inquiry of the first chap he happened to meet; for Vasily had an uncanny awareness of where people were at any given time. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“She is in the card room, I believe.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Ah,” said the Count with a knowing smile. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Turning about, he walked down the hall to the card room and quietly opened the door, assuming he would find four middle-aged ladies exchanging cookies and profanities over tricks of whist—as an attentive spirit held her breath in a cupboard. Instead, he found the object of his search sitting at the card table alone. With two stacks of paper in front of her and a pencil in hand, she appeared the very model of scholastic enthusiasm. The pencil was moving so brightly it looked like an honor guard—parading across the page with its head held high then pivoting at the margin to make the quick march back. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Greetings, my friend.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Hello, Your Countship,” Nina replied without looking up from her work. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Would you like to join me for an excursion before dinner? I was thinking of visiting the switchboard.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’m afraid I can’t at the moment.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The Count claimed the seat opposite Nina as she put a completed sheet of paper on one stack and took a fresh sheet of paper from the other. Out of habit, he picked up the deck of cards that sat on the corner of the table and shuffled it twice. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Would you like to see a trick?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Some other time, perhaps.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Neatening the deck, the Count replaced it on the table. Then he picked up the topmost sheet from the stack of completed papers. In carefully</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p133"></a>aligned columns, he found all of the cardinal numbers from 1,100 to 1,199. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In accordance with some unknown system, thirteen of the numbers had been circled in red. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Needless to say, the Count was intrigued. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What are we up to here?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Mathematics.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I see you are addressing the subject with vigor.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Professor Lisitsky says that one must wrestle with mathematics the way that one wrestles with a bear.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Is that so? And which species of bear are we wrestling with today? </p>
<p class="calibre1">More polar than panda, I suspect.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nina looked up at the Count with her glint-extinguishing stare. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The Count cleared his throat and adopted a more serious tone. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I take it the project involves some subset of integers. . . .” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Do you know what a prime number is?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“As in two, three, five, seven, eleven, thirteen . . . ?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Exactly,” said Nina. “Those whole numbers that are  <i class="calibre3">indivisible</i> by any number other than one and itself.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Given the dramatic manner with which she had said  <i class="calibre3">indivisible</i>, one might have imagined Nina was speaking of the impregnability of a fortress. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“At any rate,” she said, “I am making a list of them all.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Them all!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It is a Sisyphean task,” she admitted (though with an enthusiasm that prompted one to wonder if she had a complete command of the term’s etymology). </p>
<p class="calibre1">She pointed to the already inscribed pages on the table. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The list of prime numbers begins with two, three, and five, as you say. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But prime numbers grow increasingly rare the larger they become. So it is one thing to land upon a seven or eleven. But to land upon a one thousand and nine is another thing altogether. Can you imagine identifying a prime number in the hundreds of thousands . . . ? In the millions . . . ?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nina looked off in the distance, as if she could see that largest and most impregnable of all the numbers situated on its rocky promontory where for thousands of years it had withstood the onslaughts of fire-breathing dragons and barbarian hordes. Then she resumed her work. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p134"></a><img class="calibre2" src="index-134_1.jpg"/></p>
<p class="calibre1">The Count took another look at the sheet in his hands with a heightened sense of respect. After all, an educated man should admire any course of study no matter how arcane, if it be pursued with curiosity and devotion. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Here,” he said in the tone of one chipping in. “This number is not prime.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nina looked up with an expression of disbelief. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Which number?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He laid the paper in front of her and tapped a figure circled in red. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“One thousand one hundred and seventy-three.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“How do you know it isn’t prime?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“If a number’s individual digits sum to a number that is divisible by three, then it too is divisible by three.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Confronted with this extraordinary fact, Nina replied:</p>
<p class="calibre1">“<i class="calibre3">Mon Dieu</i>.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Then she leaned back in her chair and appraised the Count in a manner acknowledging that she may have underestimated him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Now, when a man has been underestimated by a friend, he has some cause for taking offense—since it is our friends who should  <i class="calibre3">overestimate</i> our capacities. They should have an exaggerated opinion of our moral fortitude, our aesthetic sensibilities, and our intellectual scope. Why, they should practically imagine us leaping through a window in the nick of time with the works of Shakespeare in one hand and a pistol in the other! But in this particular instance, the Count had to admit he had little grounds for taking offense. Because, for the life of him, he could not imagine from what dark corner of his adolescent mind this extraordinary fact had materialized. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well,” said Nina, pointing to the stack of completed papers in front of the Count. “You’d better hand me those.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Leaving Nina to her work, the Count consoled himself that he was to meet Mishka for dinner in fifteen minutes; and besides, he had yet to read the daily papers. So, returning to the lobby, he picked up a copy of  <i class="calibre3">Pravda</i> from the coffee table and made himself comfortable in the chair between the potted palms. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p135"></a>After scanning the headlines, the Count delved into an article on a Moscow manufacturing plant that was exceeding its quotas. He then read a sketch on various improvements in Russian village life. When he shifted his attention to a report on the grateful schoolchildren of Kazan, he couldn’t help but remark on the repetitiveness of the new journalistic style. Not only did the Bolsheviks seem to dwell on the same sort of subject matter day to day, they celebrated such a narrow set of views with such a limited vocabulary that one inevitably felt as if one had read it all before. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It wasn’t until the fifth article that the Count realized he  <i class="calibre3">had</i> read it all before. For this was yesterday’s paper. With a grunt, he tossed it back on the table and looked at the clock behind the front desk, which indicated that Mishka was now fifteen minutes late. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But then, the measure of fifteen minutes is entirely different for a man in step than for a man with nothing to do. If for the Count the prior twelve months could be characterized politely as uneventful, the same could not be said for Mishka. The Count’s old friend had left the 1923 RAPP congress with a commission to edit and annotate a multivolume anthology of the Russian short story. That alone would have provided him with a reasonable excuse for being late; but there was a second development in Mishka’s life that earned him even more latitude with his appointments. . . . </p>
<p class="calibre1">As a boy, the Count had a well-deserved reputation for marksmanship. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He had been known to hit the schoolhouse bell with a rock while standing behind the bushes on the other side of the yard. He had been known to sink a kopek into an inkwell from across the classroom. And with an arrow and bow, he could pierce an orange at fifty paces. But he had never hit a tighter mark from a greater distance than when he noted his friend’s interest in Katerina from Kiev. In the months after the 1923 congress, her beauty became so indisputable, her heart so tender, her demeanor so kind, that Mishka had no choice but to barricade himself behind a stack of books at the old Imperial Library in St. Petersburg. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“She’s a firefly, Sasha. A pinwheel.” Or so said Mishka with the wistful amazement of one who has been given only a moment to admire a wonder of the world. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But then one autumn afternoon, she appeared in his alcove in need of a confidant. Behind his volumes, they whispered for an hour, and when the library sounded its closing bell, they took their conversation out onto</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p136"></a><img class="calibre2" src="index-136_1.jpg"/></p>
<p class="calibre1">Nevsky Prospekt and wandered all the way to Tikhvin Cemetery where, on a spot overlooking the Neva River, this firefly, this pinwheel, this wonder of the world had suddenly taken his hand. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Ah, Count Rostov,” exclaimed Arkady in passing. “There you are. I believe I have a message for you. . . .” Returning to the front desk, Arkady quickly rifled through some notes. “Here.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The message, which had been taken down by the hotel’s receptionist, conveyed Mishka’s apologies and explained that as Katerina was under the weather, he was returning to St. Petersburg earlier than planned. Taking a moment to mask his disappointment, the Count looked up from the note to thank Arkady, but the desk captain had already turned his attention to another guest. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Good evening, Count Rostov.” Andrey took a quick look in the Book. “A party of two tonight, isn’t it?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’m afraid it’s going to be a party of one, Andrey.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Nonetheless, it is our pleasure to have you. Your table should be ready in just a few minutes.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">With the recent recognition of the USSR by Germany, England, and Italy, a wait of a few minutes had become increasingly common at the Boyarsky; but such was the price of being welcomed back into the sisterhood of nations and the brotherhood of trade. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As the Count stepped aside, a man with a pointed beard came marching down the hallway with a protégé in tow. Though the Count had only seen him once or twice before, the Count could tell he was the Commissar of Something-or-Other, for he walked with urgency, talked with urgency, and even came to a stop with urgency. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Good evening, comrade Soslovsky,” said Andrey with a welcoming smile. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes,” pronounced Soslovsky—as if he’d just been asked whether he wanted to be seated immediately. </p>
<p class="calibre1">With a nod of understanding, Andrey signaled a waiter, handed him two menus, and directed him to lead the gentlemen to table fourteen. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p137"></a>Geometrically speaking, the Boyarsky was a square at the center of which was a towering arrangement of flora (today forsythia branches in bloom), around which were twenty tables of various sizes. If one considered the tables in respect to the cardinal points of a compass, then, at Andrey’s instruction, the waiter was now leading the Commissar and his protégé to the table for two at the northeast corner—right next to where a jowly-faced Belarusian was dining. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Andrey, my friend . . .” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The maître d’ looked up from his Book. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Isn’t he the chap who had an exchange of words with that bulldog of a fellow a few days ago?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">An “exchange of words” was something of a polite diminution of the facts. For on the afternoon in question, when this Soslovsky had wondered aloud to his luncheon companions why the Belarusians seemed particularly slow to embrace the ideas of Lenin, the bulldog (who had been sitting at a neighboring table) had cast his napkin on his plate and demanded to know</p>
<p class="calibre1">“the meaning of this!” With a disregard as pointed as his beard, Soslovsky suggested there were three reasons, and he began to tick them off:</p>
<p class="calibre1">“First, there is the relative laziness of the population—a trait for which the Belarusians are known the world over. Second, there is their infatuation with the West, which presumably stems from their long history of intermarriage with the Poles. But third, and above all else—” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Alas, the restaurant was never to hear the above-all-else. For the bulldog, who had knocked back his chair at the word  <i class="calibre3">intermarriage</i>, now hoisted Soslovsky off his seat. In the scramble that ensued, it took three waiters to separate the various hands from the various lapels, and two busboys to sweep the chicken Maréchal from the floor. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Recalling the scene in a flash, Andrey looked back toward table thirteen, where the bulldog in question was currently seated with a woman of such similar aspect that any seasoned logician would conclude she was his wife. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Spinning on his heels, Andrey rounded the forsythia blossoms, headed off Soslovsky and his protégé, and led them back to table three—a lovely spot at south-southeast, which could comfortably accommodate a party of four. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“<i class="calibre3">Merci beaucoup</i>,” said Andrey upon his return. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“<i class="calibre3">De rien</i>,” replied the Count. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p138"></a><img class="calibre2" src="index-138_1.jpg"/></p>
<p class="calibre1">In replying  <i class="calibre3">It is nothing</i> to Andrey, the Count was not simply resorting to a Gallic figure of speech. In point of fact, the Count deserved as much thanks for his little intervention as a swallow deserves for its trill. For since the age of fifteen, Alexander Rostov had been a master of seating tables. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Whenever he was home for the holidays, his grandmother would inevitably call him into the library, where she liked to knit by the fireplace in a solitary chair. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Come in, my boy, and sit with me a moment.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Certainly, Grandmother,” replied the Count, balancing himself on the edge of the fire grate. “How can I be of assistance?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The prelate is coming for dinner on Friday night—as are the Duchess Obolensky, Count Keragin,  <i class="calibre3">and</i> the Minsky-Polotovs. . . .” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Here she would let her voice trail off without further explanation; but no further explanation was needed. The Countess was of a mind that dinner should provide one with respite from life’s trials and tribulations. Thus, she could not countenance discussions of religion, politics, or personal sorrows at her table. Further complicating matters, the prelate was deaf in his left ear, partial to Latin epigrams, and prone to stare at décolletage whenever he drank a glass of wine; while the Duchess Obolensky, who was particularly caustic in summer, frowned upon pithy sayings and could not abide discussions of the arts. And the Keragins? Their great-grandfather had been called a Bonapartist by Prince Minsky-Polotov in 1811, and they had not exchanged a word with a Minsky-Polotov since. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“How many will be in attendance?” asked the Count. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Forty.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The usual assembly?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“More or less.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The Osipovs?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes. But Pierre is in Moscow. . . .” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Ah,” said the Count with the smile of the chess champion who has been confronted with a new gambit. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The Nizhny Novgorod Province had a hundred prominent families, which over the course of two centuries had intermarried and divorced, </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p139"></a><img class="calibre2" src="index-139_1.jpg"/></p>
<p class="calibre1">borrowed and lent, accepted and regretted, offended, defended, and dueled</p>
<p class="calibre1">—while championing an array of conflicting positions that varied by generation, gender, and house. And at the center of this maelstrom was the Countess Rostov’s dining room with its two tables for twenty standing side by side. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Not to worry,  <i class="calibre3">Grand-mère</i>,” assured the Count. “A solution is close at hand.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Out in the garden, as the Count closed his eyes to begin moving through the individual permutations one by one, his sister enjoyed making light of his task. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Why do you furrow your brow so, Sasha? However the table is arranged, we always have such delightful conversations when we dine.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“However the table is arranged!” the Count would exclaim. “Delightful conversations! I’ll have you know, dear sister, that careless seating has torn asunder the best of marriages and led to the collapse of the longest-standing <i class="calibre3">détentes</i>. In fact, if Paris had not been seated next to Helen when he dined in the court of Menelaus, there never would have been a Trojan War.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">A charming rejoinder, no doubt, reflected the Count, from across the years. But where were the Obolenskys and the Minsky-Polotovs now? </p>
<p class="calibre1">With Hector and Achilles. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Your table is ready, Count Rostov.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Ah. Thank you, Andrey.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Two minutes later, the Count was comfortably seated at his table with a glass of champagne (a small gesture of thanks from Andrey for his timely intervention). </p>
<p class="calibre1">Taking a sip, the Count reviewed the menu in reverse order as was his habit, having learned from experience that giving consideration to appetizers before entrées can only lead to regrets. And here was a perfect example. For the very last item on the menu was the evening’s sole necessity: osso buco—a dish that was best preceded by a light and lively appetizer. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Closing his menu, the Count surveyed the restaurant. Undeniably, he had felt a little low when he had climbed the stairs to the Boyarsky; but here</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p140"></a>he was with a glass of champagne in hand, osso buco in the offing, and the satisfaction that he had been of service to a friend. Perhaps the Fates—who of all their children loved Reversal most—were set upon lifting his spirits. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Do you have any questions?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Thus came an inquiry from behind the Count’s back. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Now admittedly, with the recent return of international guests to the hotel, the Boyarsky had become a little understaffed. So the Count could well appreciate why Andrey had decided to bolster his crew. But of all the waiters at the Piazza, of all the waiters in the world, why would he choose <i class="calibre3">this</i> one? </p>
<p class="calibre1">The Bishop seemed to be following the Count’s train of thought, for his smile became especially smug.  <i class="calibre3">Yes</i>, he seemed to be saying,  <i class="calibre3">here I am in</i> <i class="calibre3">your famed Boyarsky, one of the chosen few who pass with impunity</i> <i class="calibre3">through the doors of Chef Zhukovsky’s kitchen. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">“Perhaps you need more time . . . ?” the Bishop suggested, his pencil poised over his pad. </p>
<p class="calibre1">For an instant, the Count considered sending him on his way and asking for a new table. But the Rostovs had always prided themselves on admitting when their behavior lacked charity. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No, my good man,” replied the Count. “I am ready to place my order. I will have the fennel and orange salad to start, and the osso buco to follow.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Of course,” said the Bishop. “And how will you be having the osso buco?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The Count almost betrayed his amazement.  <i class="calibre3">How will I be having it? </i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">Does he expect me to dictate the temperature of a piece of stewed meat? </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">“As the chef prepares it,” replied the Count magnanimously. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Of course. And will you be having wine?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Absolutely. A bottle of the San Lorenzo Barolo, 1912.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Will you be having the red or the white?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“A Barolo,” the Count explained as helpfully as he could, “is a full-bodied red from northern Italy. As such, it is the perfect accompaniment to the osso buco of Milan.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p141"></a>“So then, you will be having the red.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The Count studied the Bishop for a moment. The fellow gives no evidence of being deaf, he reflected; and his accent would suggest that Russian is his native tongue. So surely, by now, he should have been on his way to the kitchen? But as the Countess Rostov liked to remark: If patience wasn’t so easily tested, then it would hardly be a virtue. . . . </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes,” said the Count after counting to five. “The Barolo is a  <i class="calibre3">red. </i>” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The Bishop continued to stand there with his pencil poised over his pad. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I apologize,” he said unapologetically, “if I am not being clear. But for your selection of a wine tonight, there are only  <i class="calibre3">two</i> options: white and red.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The two men stared at each other. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Perhaps you could ask Andrey to stop by for a moment.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Of course,” said the Bishop, backing away with an ecclesiastical bow. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The Count drummed the tabletop with his fingers. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">Of course, he says. Of course, of course, of course. Of course what? Of</i> <i class="calibre3">course you are there and I am here? Of course you have said something and</i> <i class="calibre3">I have replied? Of course a man’s time on earth is finite and may come to</i> <i class="calibre3">an end at any moment! </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">“Is something the matter, Count Rostov?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Ah, Andrey. It’s about your new man. I’m quite familiar with him from his work downstairs. And in that venue I suppose a certain lack of experience is to be tolerated, or even expected. But here at the Boyarsky . . .” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The Count opened both hands to gesture toward the hallowed room and then looked to the maître d’ with an expectation of understanding. </p>
<p class="calibre1">No one who knew Andrey in the slightest would ever describe his demeanor as gay. He was not some barker at a carnival, or an impresario of light entertainments. His position as the maître d’ of the Boyarsky called for judiciousness, tact, decorum. So the Count was quite accustomed to Andrey having a solemn expression. But in all his years of dining at the Boyarsky, he had never seen Andrey appear  <i class="calibre3">this</i> solemn. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“He was promoted at the instruction of Mr. Halecki,” explained the maître d’ quietly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But why?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I am not certain. I presume he has a friend.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“A friend?” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p142"></a><img class="calibre2" src="index-142_1.jpg"/></p>
<p class="calibre1">Uncharacteristically, Andrey shrugged. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“A friend with influence. Someone within the Table Servers Union, perhaps; or at the Commissariat of Labor; or in the upper echelons of the Party. These days, who can tell?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“My sympathies,” said the Count. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Andrey bowed in gratitude. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well, you certainly can’t be held accountable if they foist the fellow upon you; and I will adjust my expectations accordingly. But before you go, can you do me a small service? For some incomprehensible reason, he will not let me order my wine. I was just hoping to get a bottle of the San Lorenzo Barolo to accompany the osso buco.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">If such a thing could be imagined, Andrey’s expression grew even more solemn. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Perhaps you should come with me. . . .” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Having followed Andrey across the dining room, through the kitchen, and down a long, winding stair, the Count found himself in a place that even Nina had never been: the wine cellar of the Metropol. </p>
<p class="calibre1">With its archways of brick and its cool, dark climate, the Metropol’s wine cellar recalled the somber beauty of a catacomb. Only, instead of sarcophagi bearing the likenesses of saints, receding into the far reaches of the chamber were rows of racks laden with bottles of wine. Here was assembled a staggering collection of Cabernets and Chardonnays, Rieslings and Syrahs, ports and Madeiras—a century of vintages from across the continent of Europe. </p>
<p class="calibre1">All told, there were almost ten thousand cases. More than a hundred thousand bottles. And every one of them without a label. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What has happened!” gasped the Count. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Andrey nodded in grim acknowledgment. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“A complaint was filed with comrade Teodorov, the Commissar of Food, claiming that the existence of our wine list runs counter to the ideals of the Revolution. That it is a monument to the privilege of the nobility, the effeteness of the intelligentsia, and the predatory pricing of speculators.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But that’s preposterous.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p143"></a>For the second time in an hour, the unshrugging Andrey shrugged. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“A meeting was held, a vote was taken, an order was handed down. . . . </p>
<p class="calibre1">Henceforth, the Boyarsky shall sell only red and white wine with every bottle at a single price.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">With a hand that was never meant to serve such a purpose, Andrey gestured to the corner, where beside five barrels of water a confusion of labels lay on the floor. “It took ten men ten days to complete the task,” he said sadly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But who on earth would file such a complaint?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I am not certain; though I have been told it may have originated with your friend. . . .” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“My friend?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Your waiter from downstairs.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The Count looked at Andrey in amazement. But then a memory presented itself—a memory of a Christmas past when the Count had leaned from his chair to correct a certain waiter’s recommendation of a Rioja to accompany a Latvian stew. How smugly the Count had observed at the time that there was no substitute for experience. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Well, thought the Count, here is your substitute. </p>
<p class="calibre1">With Andrey a few paces behind him, the Count began walking the cellar’s center aisle, much as a commander and his lieutenant might walk through a field hospital in the aftermath of battle. Near the end of the aisle, the Count turned down one of the rows. With a quick accounting of columns and shelves, the Count determined that in this row alone, there were over a thousand bottles—a thousand bottles virtually identical in shape and weight. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Picking up one at random, he reflected how perfectly the curve of the glass fit in the palm of the hand, how perfectly its volume weighed upon the arm. But inside? Inside this dark green glass was what exactly? A Chardonnay to complement a Camembert? A Sauvignon Blanc to go with some chèvre? </p>
<p class="calibre1">Whichever wine was within, it was decidedly not identical to its neighbors. On the contrary, the contents of the bottle in his hand was the product of a history as unique and complex as that of a nation, or a man. In its color, aroma, and taste, it would certainly express the idiosyncratic geology and prevailing climate of its home terrain. But in addition, it would</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p144"></a>express all the natural phenomena of its  <i class="calibre3">vintage</i>. In a sip, it would evoke the timing of that winter’s thaw, the extent of that summer’s rain, the prevailing winds, and the frequency of clouds. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Yes, a bottle of wine was the ultimate distillation of time and place; a poetic expression of individuality itself. Yet here it was, cast back into the sea of anonymity, that realm of averages and unknowns. </p>
<p class="calibre1">And suddenly, the Count had his own moment of lucidity. Just as Mishka had come to understand the present as the natural by-product of the past, and could see with perfect clarity how it would shape the future, the Count now understood  <i class="calibre3">his</i> place in the passage of time. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As we age, we are bound to find comfort from the notion that it takes generations for a way of life to fade. We are familiar with the songs our grandparents favored, after all, even though we never danced to them ourselves. At festive holidays, the recipes we pull from the drawer are routinely decades old, and in some cases even written in the hand of a relative long since dead. And the objects in our homes? The oriental coffee tables and well-worn desks that have been handed down from generation to generation? Despite being “out of fashion,” not only do they add beauty to our daily lives, they lend material credibility to our presumption that the passing of an era will be glacial. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But under certain circumstances, the Count finally acknowledged, this process can occur in the comparative blink of an eye. Popular upheaval, political turmoil, industrial progress—any combination of these can cause the evolution of a society to leapfrog generations, sweeping aside aspects of the past that might otherwise have lingered for decades. And this must be especially so, when those with newfound power are men who distrust any form of hesitation or nuance, and who prize self-assurance above all. </p>
<p class="calibre1">For years now, with a bit of a smile, the Count had remarked that this or that was behind him—like his days of poetry or travel or romance. But in so doing, he had never really believed it. In his heart of hearts, he had imagined that, even if unattended to, these aspects of his life were lingering somewhere on the periphery, waiting to be recalled. But looking at the bottle in his hand, the Count was struck by the realization that, in fact, it <i class="calibre3">was</i> all behind him. Because the Bolsheviks, who were so intent upon recasting the future from a mold of their own making, would not rest until every last vestige of his Russia had been uprooted, shattered, or erased. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p145"></a>Returning the bottle to its slot, the Count went to join Andrey at the foot of the stairs. But as he passed among the shelves, it occurred to him that it was  <i class="calibre3">almost</i> all behind him. For he had one last duty to attend to. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Just a moment, Andrey.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Starting at the end of the cellar, the Count began weaving back and forth through the rows systematically, scanning the racks from top to bottom, until Andrey must have thought he’d lost his reason. But in the sixth row he came to a stop. Reaching down to a shelf at the height of his knee, the Count carefully took a bottle from among the thousands. Holding it up with a wistful smile, he ran his thumb over the insignia of the two crossed keys that was embossed on the glass. </p>
<p class="calibre1">On the twenty-second of June 1926—the tenth anniversary of Helena’s death—Count Alexander Ilyich Rostov would drink to his sister’s memory. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Then he would shed this mortal coil, once and for all. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p146"></a><b class="calibre4">1926</b></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3"><b class="calibre4">Adieu</b></i></p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre4">I</b>t is a fact of human life that one must eventually choose a philosophy. Or such was the opinion of the Count, as he stood before his old windows in suite 317, having slipped inside with the help of Nina’s key. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Whether through careful consideration spawned by books and spirited debate over coffee at two in the morning, or simply from a natural proclivity, we must all eventually adopt a fundamental framework, some reasonably coherent system of causes and effects that will help us make sense not simply of momentous events, but of all the little actions and interactions that constitute our daily lives—be they deliberate or spontaneous, inevitable or unforeseen. </p>
<p class="calibre1">For most Russians, the philosophical consolations had been found for centuries under the eaves of the church. Whether they favored the unflinching hand of the Old Testament or the more forgiving hand of the New, their submission to the will of God helped them to understand, or at least accept the inescapable course of events. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In keeping with the fashion of the times, most of the Count’s schoolmates had turned their backs on the church; but they had only done so in favor of alternative consolations. Some who preferred the clarity of science adhered to the ideas of Darwin, seeing at every turn the mark of natural selection; while others opted for Nietzsche and his eternal recurrence or Hegel and his dialectic—each system quite sensible, no doubt, when one had finally arrived at the one-thousandth page. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But for the Count, his philosophical leanings had always been essentially meteorological. Specifically, he believed in the inevitable influence of clement and inclement weathers. He believed in the influence of early frosts and lingering summers, of ominous clouds and delicate rains, </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p147"></a>of fog and sunshine and snowfall. And he believed, most especially, in the reshaping of destinies by the slightest change in the thermometer. </p>
<p class="calibre1">By way of example, one need only look down from this window. Not three weeks before—with the temperature hovering around 45˚ Fahrenheit</p>
<p class="calibre1">—Theatre Square had been empty and gray. But with an increase in the average temperature of just five degrees, the trees had begun to blossom, the sparrows had begun to sing, and couples young and old were lingering on the benches. If such a slight change in temperature was all it took to transform the life of a public square, why should we think the course of human history any less susceptible? </p>
<p class="calibre1">Napoleon would have been the first to admit that after assembling an intrepid corps of commanders and fifteen divisions, after assessing the enemy’s weaknesses, studying his terrain, and carefully formulating a plan of attack, one must finally contend with temperature. For the reading on the thermometer will not only govern the pace of advance, but will also determine the adequacy of supplies, and either bolster or betray the courage of one’s men. (Ah, Napoleon, perhaps you would never have prevailed in your quest for Mother Russia; but ten degrees warmer and at least you might have reached home with half your forces intact, instead of losing another three hundred thousand men between the gates of Moscow and the banks of the Neman River.)</p>
<p class="calibre1">But if examples from the field of battle are not to your taste, then consider instead a party in late autumn to which you and a loose-knit band of friends and acquaintances have been invited to celebrate the twenty-first birthday of the charming Princess Novobaczky. . . . </p>
<p class="calibre1">At five o’clock, when you look from your dressing room window, the weather seems certain to weigh upon the festivities. For with the temperature at 34˚, clouds as far as the eye can see, and the onset of a drizzling rain, the Princess’s guests will be arriving at her party cold, wet, and a little worse for wear. But by the time you set out at six, the temperature has dropped just enough that what begins to land on your shoulders is not a gray, autumnal rain, but the season’s first snowfall. Thus, the very precipitation that might have soured the evening, instead lends it an aura of magic. In fact, so mesmerizing is the manner in which the snowflakes spiral through the air that you are run from the road when a</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p148"></a>troika passes at full gallop—with a young officer of the Hussars standing at the reins like a centurion in his chariot. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Having spent an hour freeing your carriage from a ditch, you arrive at the Princess’s late but, as luck would have it, so does a portly old friend from your days at the academy. In fact, you get to watch as he alights from his droshky, throws back his shoulders, fills out his chest, and then tests the formality of the footmen—by slipping on a patch of ice and landing on his rump. Helping him up, you hook your arm under his and lead him into the house just as the rest of the party is spilling from the drawing room. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In the dining room, you make a quick circle of the table in search of your name, assuming that—given your reputation as a raconteur—you will once again be placed beside some awkward cousin. But lo and behold, you have been seated at the right hand of the guest of honor. While on the Princess’s left . . . is none other than the dashing young Hussar who had run you from the road. </p>
<p class="calibre1">With a glance, you can see that he fancies himself the natural recipient of the Princess’s attention. Clearly, he expects to regale her with tales of the regiment while occasionally refilling her glass with wine. When the meal is over, he will offer his arm and lead her into the ballroom, where he will display his talents at the mazurka. And when the orchestra plays Strauss, he will not need to waltz the Princess across the floor, because he will be on the terrace in her arms. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But just as the young lieutenant is about to tell his first anecdote, the doors to the kitchen open and three footmen appear bearing platters. All eyes turn to see what Mrs. Trent has prepared for the occasion, and when the three silver domes are lifted simultaneously there are gasps of appreciation. For in honor of the Princess, she has cooked her specialty: English roast with Yorkshire pudding. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In the history of man, no military commissary has raised envy. Due to a combination of efficiency, disinterest, and the lack of a feminine touch, all of the food in an army kitchen is boiled until the tops rattle off the pots. So, having made do with cabbage and potatoes for three months straight, the young lieutenant is unprepared for the arrival of Mrs. Trent’s beef. Seared for fifteen minutes at 450˚ and then roasted for two hours at 350˚, her roast is tender and red at the center yet crispy and brown at the crust. Thus, our young Hussar sets aside his regimental tales in favor of extra helpings and</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p149"></a>the refilling of his own glass with wine; while in accordance with the established rules of etiquette, it is you who must entertain the Princess with a few amusing stories of your own. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Having cleaned the gravy from his plate with the last crust of the pudding, the young lieutenant finally turns his attention to his hostess; but at that very same moment, the orchestra begins tuning in the ballroom and the guests push back their chairs. So he simply holds out his arm for the Princess, as your portly friend appears at your side. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Now, there is nothing your friend loves better than a good quadrille; and despite his physique, he has been known to hop like a rabbit and prance like a buck. But placing his hand on his tailbone, he explains that his spill on the drive has left him too sore to gallivant. He wonders, instead, if you’d like to play a few hands of cards and you respond it would be your pleasure. But it just so happens that the lieutenant overhears this exchange and, in a boisterous frame of mind, imagines that here is a perfect opportunity to teach some dandies a thing or two about games of chance. Besides, he reasons to himself, the orchestra will be playing for hours and the Princess is going nowhere. So without further thought, he passes her arm to the nearest gentleman and invites himself to join you at the card table—while signaling the butler for another glass of wine. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Well. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Perhaps it was that extra glass of wine. Perhaps it was the lieutenant’s tendency to underestimate a well-dressed man. Or perhaps it was simply bad luck. Whatever the cause, suffice it to say that after two hours, it is the lieutenant who has lost one thousand rubles and you who hold his marker. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But however recklessly the fellow drives his troika, you have no wish to put him in a spot. “It is the Princess’s birthday,” you say. “In her honor, let us call it even.” And with that, you tear the lieutenant’s marker in two and toss the halves on the baize. In appreciation, he sweeps his wine glass to the floor, knocks back his chair, and stumbles out the terrace doors into the night. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Although in the course of the game there were only five players and three observers, the story of the torn IOU quickly makes its way around the ballroom, and suddenly the Princess has sought you out in order to express her gratitude for this act of gallantry. As you bow and reply  <i class="calibre3">It is nothing</i>, </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p150"></a><img class="calibre2" src="index-150_1.jpg"/></p>
<p class="calibre1"><img class="calibre2" src="index-150_2.jpg"/></p>
<p class="calibre1">the band strikes up a waltz and you have no choice but to take her in your arms and spirit her across the floor. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The Princess waltzes divinely. She is light on her feet and spins like a top. But with more than forty couples dancing and the fires in the two fireplaces built unusually high, the ambient temperature in the ballroom reaches 80˚, prompting the Princess’s cheeks to flush and her bosom to heave. Concerned that she may be feeling faint, naturally, you inquire if she would like some air. . . . </p>
<p class="calibre1">You see? </p>
<p class="calibre1">If Mrs. Trent had not so perfectly mastered the art of roasting, the young lieutenant might have kept his attention on the Princess instead of washing down a third helping of beef with an eighth glass of wine. If the temperature that night had not dropped six degrees in as many hours, the ice might not have formed in the drive, your portly friend might not have fallen, and the card game might not have been played. And if the sight of snow hadn’t prompted the footmen to build the fires so high, you might not have ended up on the terrace in the arms of the birthday girl—as a young Hussar returned his supper to the pasture from whence it came. </p>
<p class="calibre1">And what is more, thought the Count with a grave expression, all the sorry events that followed might never have come to pass. . . . </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What is this? Who are you?” </p>

<p class="calibre1">“What are you doing here?” the husband demanded. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I am . . . from the drapers,” the Count replied. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Turning back to the window, he took hold of the curtain and gave it a tug. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes,” he said. “Everything seems in order.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Then he doffed the cap he wasn’t wearing and escaped into the hall. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Good evening, Vasily.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh. Good evening, Count Rostov.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p151"></a>The Count gave the desk a delicate tap. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Have you seen Nina about?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“She is in the ballroom, I believe.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Ah. Just so.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The Count was pleasantly surprised to hear that Nina was back in one of her old haunts. Now thirteen, Nina had all but given up her youthful pastimes in favor of books and professors. To have set aside her studies, there must have been quite an Assembly assembled. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But when the Count opened the door, there was no shuffling of chairs or pounding of podiums. Nina was sitting alone at a small table under the central chandelier. The Count noted that her hair was tucked behind her ears, an unfailing indication that something of significance was in the works. Sure enough, on the pad before her was a six by three grid, while on the table sat a set of scales, a measuring tape, and a sprinter’s watch. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Greetings, my friend.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh, hello, Your Countship.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What, pray tell, are you up to?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We are preparing for an experiment.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The Count looked around the ballroom. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nina pointed with her pencil to the balcony. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Nina made the introductions. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Count Rostov, Boris. Boris, Count Rostov.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Good afternoon, Boris.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Good afternoon, sir.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The Count turned back to Nina. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What is the nature of this endeavor?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We intend to test the hypotheses of two renowned mathematicians in a single experiment. Specifically, we will be testing Newton’s calculation of the speed of gravity and Galileo’s principle that objects with different mass fall at an equivalent rate.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">From the balustrade, wide-eyed Boris nodded earnestly and attentively. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p152"></a>By way of illustration, Nina pointed her pencil to the first column of her grid, in which six objects were listed in ascending order of size. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Where did you get the pineapple?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“From the fruit bowl in the lobby,” Boris called down with enthusiasm. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nina set down her pencil. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">“</i> Let’s start with the kopek, Boris. Remember to hold it  <i class="calibre3">precisely</i> at the top of the balustrade, and drop it  <i class="calibre3">exactly</i> when I tell you to do so.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">For a moment, the Count wondered if the height of the balcony was sufficient to measure the influence of mass on the descent of varying objects. After all, hadn’t Galileo climbed the Tower of Pisa when he executed his experiment? And surely, the balcony wasn’t high enough to calculate the acceleration of gravity. But it is hardly the role of the casual observer to call into question the methodology of the seasoned scientist. So, the Count kept his wonderings where they belonged. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Boris took up the kopek and, showing due consideration for the seriousness of his task, he carefully arranged himself so that he could hold the designated object  <i class="calibre3">precisely</i> at the top of the balustrade. </p>
<p class="calibre1">After making a notation on her pad, Nina picked up her watch. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“On the count of three, Boris. One. Two. Three!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Boris released the coin and after a moment of silence, it pinged against the floor. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nina looked at her watch. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“One point two five seconds,” she called to Boris. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Check,” he replied. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Carefully noting the datum in its corresponding square, on a separate sheet of paper Nina divided the figure by a factor, carried its remainder, subtracted the difference, and so on and so forth, until she rounded the solution to the second decimal. Then she shook her head in apparent disappointment. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Thirty-two feet per second per second.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Boris responded with an expression of scientific concern. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The egg,” Nina said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The egg (which presumably had been liberated from the Piazza’s kitchen) was held precisely, released exactly, and timed to the centisecond. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The experiment continued with a teacup, a billiard ball, a dictionary, and the pineapple, all of which completed their journey to the dance floor in the</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p153"></a><img class="calibre2" src="index-153_1.jpg"/></p>
<p class="calibre1">same amount of time. Thus, in the ballroom of the Metropol Hotel on the twenty-first of June 1926, was the heretic, Galileo of Galilei, vindicated by a ping, a splat, a smash, a thunk, a thump, and a thud. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Of the six objects, the teacup was the Count’s personal favorite. It not only made a satisfying smash upon impact, but in the immediate aftermath one could hear the shards of porcelain skidding across the floor like acorns across the ice. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Having completed her tally, Nina observed a little sadly:</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Professor Lisitsky said that these hypotheses have been tested over time. . . .” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes,” said the Count. “I imagine they have. . . .” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Then to lighten her spirits, he suggested that as it was almost eight o’clock, perhaps she and her young friend might join him for supper at the Boyarsky. Alas, she and Boris had another experiment to perform—one that involved a bucket of water, a bicycle, and the perimeter of Red Square. </p>
<p class="calibre1">On this of all nights, was the Count disappointed that Nina and her young friend couldn’t join him for supper? Of course he was. And yet, the Count had always been of the opinion that God, who could easily have split the hours of darkness and light right down the middle, had chosen instead to make the days of summer longer for scientific expeditions of just this very sort. In addition, the Count had a pleasant inkling that Boris might prove to be the first in a long line of earnest and attentive young men who would be dropping eggs from balustrades and riding bikes with buckets. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Then I leave you to it,” said the Count with a smile. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“All right. But had you come for something in particular?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No,” the Count replied after a pause, “nothing in particular.” But as he turned toward the door, something did occur to him. “Nina . . .” </p>
<p class="calibre1">She looked up from her work. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Even though these hypotheses have been tested over time, I think you were perfectly right to test them again.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nina studied the Count for a moment. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes,” she said with a nod. “You have always known me the best.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p154"></a>At ten o’clock the Count was seated in the Boyarsky with an empty plate and a nearly empty bottle of White on the table. With the day drawing rapidly to a close, he took some pride in knowing that everything was in order. </p>
<p class="calibre1">That morning, having received a visit from Konstantin Konstantinovich, the Count had brought his accounts up to date at Muir &amp; Mirrielees (now known as the Central Universal Department Store), Filippov’s (the First Moscow Bakery), and, of course, the Metropol. At the Grand Duke’s desk, he had written a letter to Mishka, which he had then entrusted to Petya with instructions it be mailed on the following day. In the afternoon, he had paid his weekly visit to the barber and tidied up his rooms. He had donned his burgundy smoking jacket (which, to be perfectly frank, was disconcertingly snug), and in its pocket he placed a single gold coin for the undertaker with instructions that he be dressed in the freshly pressed black suit (which had been laid out on his bed), and that his body be buried in the family plot at Idlehour. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But if the Count took pride in knowing that everything was in order, he took comfort in knowing that the world would carry on without him—and, in fact, already had. The night before, he had happened to be standing at the concierge’s desk when Vasily produced a map of Moscow for one of the hotel’s guests. As Vasily drew a zigzagging line from the center of the city to the Garden Ring, more than half of the streets he named were unfamiliar to the Count. Earlier that day, Vasily had informed him that the famed blue-and-gold lobby of the Bolshoi had been painted over in white, while in the Arbat Andreyev’s moody statue of Gogol had been plucked from its pedestal and replaced with a more uplifting one of Gorky. Just like that, the city of Moscow could boast new street names, new lobbies, and new statues</p>
<p class="calibre1">—and neither the tourists, the theatergoers, nor the pigeons seemed particularly put out. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The staffing trend that had begun with the appointment of the Bishop had continued unabated—such that any young man with more influence than experience could now don the white jacket, clear from the left, and pour wine into water glasses. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Marina, who once had welcomed the Count’s company as she stitched in the stitching room, now had a junior seamstress to watch over as well as a toddler at home (God bless). </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p155"></a><img class="calibre2" src="index-155_1.jpg"/></p>
<p class="calibre1">Nina, who had taken her first steps into the modern world and found it just as worthy of her unblinking intelligence as the study of princesses, was moving with her father to a large apartment in one of the new buildings designated for the use of Party officials. </p>
<p class="calibre1">And as it was the third week of June, the Fourth Annual Congress of RAPP was underway, but Mishka was not in attendance, having taken a leave from his post at the university in order to finish his short story anthology (now in five volumes) and to follow his Katerina back to Kiev, where she was teaching in an elementary school. </p>
<p class="calibre1">On occasion, the Count still shared a cup of coffee on the roof with the handyman, Abram, where they would talk of summer nights in Nizhny Novgorod. But the old man was now so nearsighted and uncertain on his feet that one morning earlier that month, as if in anticipation of his retirement, the bees had disappeared from their hives. </p>
<p class="calibre1">So, yes, life was rolling along, just as it always had. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Looking back, the Count recalled how on the first night of his house arrest, in the spirit of his godfather’s old maxim, he had committed himself to mastering his circumstances. Well, in retrospect, there was another story his godfather told that was just as worthy of emulation. It entailed the Grand Duke’s close friend, Admiral Stepan Makarov, who commanded the Imperial Russian Navy during the Russo-Japanese War. On the thirteenth of April 1904, with Port Arthur under attack, Makarov led his battleships into the fray and drove the Japanese fleet back into the Yellow Sea. But upon returning to port on calm seas, the flagship struck a Japanese mine and began to take on water. So, with the battle won and the shores of his homeland in sight, Makarov ascended to the helm in full military dress and went down with his ship. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The Count’s bottle of White (which he was fairly certain was a Chardonnay from Burgundy and best served at 55˚) sat sweating on the table. Reaching across his plate, he picked up the bottle and served himself. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Then having made a toast of gratitude to the Boyarsky, the Count emptied his glass and headed to the Shalyapin for one last snifter of brandy. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p156"></a>When the Count arrived at the Shalyapin, his plan had been to enjoy the brandy, pay Audrius his respects, then retire to his study to await the chime of twelve. But as he neared the bottom of his glass, he couldn’t help but overhear a conversation taking place farther down the bar between a high-spirited young Brit and a German traveler for whom travel had obviously lost all its charms. </p>
<p class="calibre1">What had first drawn the Count’s attention was the Brit’s enthusiasm for Russia. In particular, the young man was taken with the whimsical architecture of the churches and the rambunctious tenor of the language. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But with a dour expression, the German replied that the only contribution the Russians had made to the West was the invention of vodka. Then, presumably to drive home his point, he emptied his glass. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Come now,” said the Brit. “You can’t be serious.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The German gave his younger neighbor the look of one who had no experience being anything but serious. “I will buy a glass of vodka,” he said, “for any man in this bar who can name three more.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Now, vodka was not the Count’s preferred spirit. In point of fact, despite his love for his country, he rarely drank it. What’s more, he had already polished off a bottle of White and a snifter of brandy, and he still had his own rather pressing business to attend to. But when a man’s country is dismissed so offhandedly, he cannot hide behind his preferences or his appointments— <i class="calibre3">especially</i> when he has drunk a bottle of White and a snifter of brandy. So, having sketched a quick instruction for Audrius on the back of a napkin and tucked it under a one-ruble note, the Count cleared his throat. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Excuse me, gentlemen. I couldn’t help but overhear your exchange. I have no doubt,  <i class="calibre3">mein Herr</i>, that your remark regarding Russia’s contributions to the West was a form of inverted hyperbole—an exaggerated diminution of the facts for poetic effect. Nonetheless, I will take you at your word and happily accept your challenge.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’ll be damned,” said the Brit. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But I do have one condition,” added the Count. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“And what is that?” asked the German. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That for each of the contributions I name, we three shall drink a glass of vodka  <i class="calibre3">together</i>.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p157"></a>The German, who was scowling, waved a hand in the air as if he were about to dismiss the Count, much as he had dismissed the country. But ever-attentive Audrius had already set three empty glasses on the bar and was filling them to the brim. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Thank you, Audrius.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“My pleasure, Your Excellency.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Number one,” said the Count, adding a pause for dramatic effect:</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Chekhov and Tolstoy.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The German let out a grunt. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes, yes. I know what you’re going to say: that every nation has its poets in the pantheon. But with Chekhov and Tolstoy, we Russians have set the bronze bookends on the mantelpiece of narrative. Henceforth, writers of fictions from wheresoever they hail, will place themselves on the continuum that begins with the one and ends with the other. For who, I ask you, has exhibited better mastery of the shorter form than Chekhov in his flawless little stories? Precise and uncluttered, they invite us into some corner of a household at some discrete hour in which the entire human condition is suddenly within reach, if heartbreakingly so. While at the other extreme: Can you conceive of a work greater in scope than  <i class="calibre3">War and Peace</i>? </p>
<p class="calibre1">One that moves so deftly from the parlor to the battlefield and back again? </p>
<p class="calibre1">That so fully investigates how the individual is shaped by history, and history by the individual? In the generations to come, I tell you there will be no new authors to supplant these two as the alpha and omega of narrative.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I daresay he has something there,” said the Brit. Then he raised his glass and emptied it. So the Count emptied his, and after a grumble, the German followed suit. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Number two?” asked the Brit, as Audrius refilled the glasses. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Act one, scene one of  <i class="calibre3">The Nutcracker</i>.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Tchaikovsky!” the German guffawed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You laugh,  <i class="calibre3">mein Herr</i>. And yet, I would wager a thousand crowns that you can picture it yourself. On Christmas Eve, having celebrated with family and friends in a room dressed with garlands, Clara sleeps soundly on the floor with her magnificent new toy. But at the stroke of midnight, with the one-eyed Drosselmeyer perched on the grandfather clock like an owl, the Christmas tree begins to grow. . . .” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p158"></a>As the Count raised his hands slowly over the bar to suggest the growth of the tree, the Brit began to whistle the famous march from the opening act. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes, exactly,” said the Count to the Brit. “It is commonly said that the English know how to celebrate Advent best. But with all due respect, to witness the essence of winter cheer one must venture farther north than London. One must venture above the fiftieth parallel to where the course of the sun is its most elliptical and the force of the wind its most unforgiving. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dark, cold, and snowbound, Russia has the sort of climate in which the spirit of Christmas burns brightest. And that is why Tchaikovsky seems to have captured the sound of it better than anyone else. I tell you that not only will every European child of the twentieth century know the melodies of <i class="calibre3">The</i> <i class="calibre3">Nutcracker</i>, they will imagine their Christmas just as it is depicted in the ballet; and on the Christmas Eves of their dotage, Tchaikovsky’s tree will grow from the floor of their memories until they are gazing up in wonder once again.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The Brit gave a sentimental laugh and emptied his glass. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The story was written by a Prussian,” said the German, as he begrudgingly lifted his drink. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I grant you that,” conceded the Count. “And but for Tchaikovsky, it would have remained in Prussia.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">As Audrius refilled the glasses, the ever-attentive tender at bar noted the Count’s look of inquiry and replied with a nod of confirmation. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Third,” said the Count. Then in lieu of explanation, he simply gestured to the Shalyapin’s entrance where a waiter suddenly appeared with a silver platter balanced on the palm of his hand. Placing the platter on the bar between the two foreigners, he lifted the dome to reveal a generous serving of caviar accompanied by blini and sour cream. Even the German could not help but smile, his appetite getting the better of his prejudices. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Anyone who has spent an hour drinking vodka by the glass knows that size has surprisingly little to do with a man’s capacity. There are tiny men for whom the limit is seven and giants for whom it is two. For our German friend, the limit appeared to be three. For if the Tolstoy dropped him in a barrel, and the Tchaikovsky set him adrift, then the caviar sent him over the falls. So, having wagged a chastising finger at the Count, he moved to the</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p159"></a>corner of the bar, laid his head on his arms, and dreamed of the Sugar Plum Fairy. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Taking this as a signal, the Count prepared to push back his stool, but the young Brit was refilling his glass. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The caviar was a stroke of genius,” he said. “But how did you manage it? You never left our sight.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“A magician never reveals his secrets.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The Brit laughed. Then he studied the Count as if with renewed curiosity. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Who are you?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The Count shrugged. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I am someone you have met in a bar.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No. That’s not quite it. I know a man of erudition when I meet one. </p>
<p class="calibre1">And I heard how the bartender referred to you. Who are you, really?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The Count offered a self-deprecating smile. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“At one time, I was Count Alexander Ilyich Rostov—recipient of the Order of Saint Andrew, member of the Jockey Club, Master of the Hunt. . . .” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The young Brit held out his hand. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Charles Abernethy—presumptive heir to the Earl of Westmorland, financier’s apprentice, and bowman of the losing Cambridge crew at Henley in 1920.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The two gentlemen shook hands and drank. And then the presumptive heir to the Earl of Westmorland studied the Count again. “This must have been quite a decade for you. . . .” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You could put it that way,” said the Count. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Did you try to leave after the Revolution?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“On the contrary, Charles; I came back because of it.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Charles looked at the Count in surprise. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You came back?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I was in Paris when the Hermitage fell. I had left the country before the war due to certain . . . circumstances.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You weren’t an anarchist, were you?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The Count laughed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Hardly.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Then what?” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p160"></a>The Count looked into his empty glass. He hadn’t spoken of these events in so many years. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It is late,” he said. “And the story is long.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">By way of response, Charles refilled their glasses. </p>
<p class="calibre1">So the Count took Charles all the way back to the fall of 1913, when on an inclement night he had set out for the twenty-first birthday of the Princess Novobaczky. He described the ice on the driveway, and Mrs. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Trent’s roast, and the torn IOU—and how a few degrees here and there had landed him on the terrace in the arms of the Princess while the rash lieutenant retched in the grass. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Charles laughed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But, Alexander, that sounds splendid. Surely, it’s not the reason you left Russia.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No,” admitted the Count, but then he continued with his fateful tale:</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Seven months pass, Charles. It is the spring of 1914, and I return to the family estate for a visit. Having paid my respects to my grandmother in the library, I venture outside in search of my sister, Helena, who likes to read under the great elm at the bend in the river. From a hundred feet away, I can tell that she is not herself—that is, I can tell that she is  <i class="calibre3">more</i> than herself. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Upon seeing me she sits up with a sparkle in her eye and a smile on her lips, clearly eager to share some piece of news, which I am now equally eager to hear. But just as I cross the lawn toward her, she looks over my shoulder and smiles even more brightly to see a lone figure approaching on a steed—</p>
<p class="calibre1">a lone figure in the uniform of the Hussars. . . . </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You see the dilemma the fox had put me in, Charles. While I had been carousing back in Moscow, he had sought my sister out. He had arranged an introduction and then courted her carefully, patiently,  <i class="calibre3">successfully</i>. And when he swung down from the saddle and our eyes met, he could barely keep the twist of mirth from his lips. But how was I to explain the situation to Helena? This angel of a thousand virtues? How was I to tell her that the man she has fallen in love with has sought her affections not due to an appreciation of her qualities, but to settle a score?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What did you do?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Ah, Charles. What did I do? I did nothing. I thought surely his true nature would find occasion to express itself—much as it had at the Novobaczkys’. So in the weeks that followed, I hovered at the edge of their</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p161"></a>courtship. I suffered through lunches and teas. I ground my teeth as I watched them stroll through the gardens. But as I bided my time, his self-control surpassed my wildest expectations. He pulled out her chair; he picked blossoms; he read verses; he  <i class="calibre3">wrote</i> verses! And always when he caught my eye there was that little twist in his smile. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But then on the afternoon of my sister’s twentieth birthday, when he was off on maneuvers and we were paying a visit to a neighbor, we returned at dusk to find his troika in front of our house. From a glance at Helena, I could sense her elation. He has rushed back all the way from his battalion, she was thinking, to wish me well on my day. She nearly jumped from her horse and ran up the steps; and I followed her like a condemned man to the noose.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The Count emptied his glass and slowly set it back onto the bar. </p>

<p class="calibre1">“When I began to express my outrage, he said: ‘Oh, come now, Alexander. It is Helena’s birthday. In her honor, let us call it even.’ Then roaring with laughter, he walked out the door without giving my sister a glance.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Charles whistled softly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The Count nodded. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But at this juncture, Charles, I did not do nothing. I crossed the entryway to the wall where a pair of pistols hung beneath the family crest. </p>
<p class="calibre1">When my sister grabbed at my sleeve and asked where I was going, I too walked out the door without giving her a glance.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The Count shook his head in condemnation of his own behavior. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“He had a one-minute head start, but he hadn’t used it to put distance between us. He had casually climbed into his troika and set his horses moving at little more than a trot. And there you have him in a nutshell, my friend: a man who raced toward parties, and trotted from his own misdeeds.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p162"></a>Charles refilled their glasses and waited. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Our drive was a grand circle that connected the house to the main road by two opposing arcs lined with apple trees. My horse was still tied at its post. So, when I saw him riding away, I mounted and set off in the opposite direction at a gallop. In a matter of minutes, I had reached the point where the two arcs of the drive met the road. Dismounting, I stood and waited for his approach. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You can picture the scene—me alone in the drive with the sky blue, the breeze blowing, and the apple trees in bloom. Though he had left the house at little more than a trot, when he saw me, he rose to his feet, raised his whip, and began driving his horses at full speed. There was no question as to what he intended to do. So without a second thought, I raised my arm, steadied my aim, and pulled the trigger. The impact of the bullet knocked him off his feet. The reins flew free and the horses careened off the drive, rolling the troika, and tossing him into the dust—where he lay unmoving.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You killed him?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes, Charles. I killed him.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The presumptive heir to the Earl of Westmorland slowly nodded his head. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Right there in the dust . . .” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The Count sighed and took a drink. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No. It was eight months later.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Charles looked confused. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Eight months later . . . ?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes. In February 1915. You see, ever since my youth I had been known for my marksmanship, and I had every intention of shooting the brute in the heart. But the road was uneven . . . and he was whipping his reins . . . and the apple blossoms were blowing about in the wind . . . In a word, I missed my mark. I ended up shooting him here.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The Count touched his right shoulder. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“So, then you didn’t kill him. . . .” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Not at that moment. After binding his wound and righting his troika, I drove him home. Along the way he cursed me at every turn of the wheel, and deservedly so. For while he survived the gunshot wound, with his right arm now lame, he was forced to surrender his commission in the Hussars. </p>
<p class="calibre1">And when his father filed an official complaint, my grandmother sent me to</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p163"></a><img class="calibre2" src="index-163_1.jpg"/></p>
<p class="calibre1">Paris, as was the custom at the time. But later that summer when the war broke out, despite his injury he insisted upon resuming his place at the head of his regiment. And in the Second Battle of the Masurian Lakes, he was knocked from his horse and run through with a bayonet by an Austrian dragoon.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">There was a moment of silence. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Alexander, I am sorry that this fellow died in battle; but I think I can safely say that you have assumed more than your share of guilt for these events.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But there is one more event to relate: Ten years ago tomorrow, while I was biding my time in Paris, my sister died.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Of a broken heart . . . ?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Young women only die of broken hearts in novels, Charles. She died of scarlet fever.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The presumptive earl shook his head in bewilderment. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But don’t you see?” explained the Count. “It is a chain of events. That night at the Novobaczkys’ when I magnanimously tore his marker, I knew perfectly well that word of the act would reach the Princess; and I took the greatest satisfaction in turning the tables on the cad. But if I had not so smugly put him in his place, he would not have pursued Helena, he would not have humiliated her, I would not have shot him, he might not have died in Masuria, and ten years ago I would have been where I belonged—at my sister’s side—when she finally breathed her last.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Having capped off his snifter of brandy with six glasses of vodka, when the Count emerged from the attic hatch shortly before midnight, he weaved across the hotel’s roof. With the wind a little wild and the building shifting back and forth, one could almost imagine one was crossing the deck of a ship on high seas. How fitting, thought the Count, as he paused to steady himself at a chimney stack. Then picking his way among the irregular shadows that jutted here and there, he approached the building’s northwest corner. </p>
<p class="calibre1">For one last time, the Count looked out upon that city that was and wasn’t his. Given the frequency of street lamps on major roads, he could</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p164"></a>easily identify the Boulevard and Garden Rings—those concentric circles at the center of which was the Kremlin and beyond which was all of Russia. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As long as there have been men on earth, reflected the Count, there have been men in exile. From primitive tribes to the most advanced societies, someone has occasionally been told by his fellow men to pack his bags, cross the border, and never set foot on his native soil again. But perhaps this was to be expected. After all, exile was the punishment that God meted out to Adam in the very first chapter of the human comedy; and that He meted out to Cain a few pages later. Yes, exile was as old as mankind. But the Russians were the first people to master the notion of sending a man into exile at home. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As early as the eighteenth century, the Tsars stopped kicking their enemies out of the country, opting instead to send them to Siberia. Why? </p>
<p class="calibre1">Because they had determined that to exile a man from Russia as God had exiled Adam from Eden was insufficient as a punishment; for in another country, a man might immerse himself in his labors, build a house, raise a family. That is, he might begin his life anew. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But when you exile a man into his  <i class="calibre3">own</i> country, there is no beginning anew. For the exile at home—whether he be sent to Siberia or subject to the Minus Six—the love for his country will not become vague or shrouded by the mists of time. In fact, because we have evolved as a species to pay the utmost attention to that which is just beyond our reach, these men are likely to dwell on the splendors of Moscow more than any Muscovite who is at liberty to enjoy them. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But enough of all that. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Having retrieved a Bordeaux glass from the Ambassador, the Count set it on a chimney top. He wrested the cork from the labelless bottle of Châteauneuf-du-Pape that he had taken from the Metropol’s cellar back in 1924. Even as he poured the wine, he could tell it was an excellent vintage. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Perhaps a 1900 or 1921. With his glass filled, he raised it in the direction of Idlehour. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“To Helena Rostov,” he said, “the flower of Nizhny Novgorod. Lover of Pushkin, defender of Alexander, embroiderer of every pillowcase within reach. A life too brief, a heart too kind.” Then he drank to the bottom of the glass. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p165"></a>Though the bottle was far from empty, the Count did not refill the glass; nor did he toss it over his shoulder. Rather, he placed it with care on the chimney top and then approached the parapet, where he stood to his full height. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Before him sprawled the city, glorious and grandiose. Its legions of lights shimmered and reeled until they mixed with the movement of the stars. In one dizzy sphere they spun, confusing the works of man with the works of heaven. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Placing his right foot on the parapet’s edge, Count Alexander Ilyich Rostov said, “Good-bye, my country.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">As if in reply, the beacon on Mishka’s tower blinked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It was now the simplest of matters. Like one who stands on a dock in spring preparing to take the first plunge of the season, all that remained was a leap. Starting just six stories off the ground and falling at the speed of a kopek, a teacup, or a pineapple, the entire journey would only take a matter of seconds; and then the circle would be complete. For as sunrise leads to sunset and dust to dust, as every river returns to the sea, just so a man must return to the embrace of oblivion, from whence—</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Your Excellency!” </p>

<p class="calibre1">“I thought I heard your voice,” said the old handyman. “I’m so glad you’re here. You must come with me at once.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Abram, my friend,” the Count began to explain, but the old man continued unabated:</p>
<p class="calibre1">“You will not believe it, if I tell you. You will have to see it for yourself.” Then without waiting for a response, he hurried with surprising agility toward his encampment. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The Count let out a sigh. Assuring the city that he would be back in a moment, he followed Abram across the roof to the brazier, where the old man stopped and pointed to the northeast corner of the hotel. And there, against the brightly lit backdrop of the Bolshoi, one could just make out a frenzy of tiny shadows darting through the air. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“They’ve returned!” Abram exclaimed. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p166"></a><img class="calibre2" src="index-166_1.jpg"/></p>
<p class="calibre1">“The bees . . . ?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes. But that is not all. Sit, sit.” Abram gestured toward the plank of wood that had so often served as the Count’s chair. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As the Count stood the plank on end, Abram bent over his makeshift table. On it was a tray from one of the hives. He cut into the comb with a knife, spread the honey on a spoon, and handed it to the Count. Then he stood back with a smile of anticipation. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well?” he prompted. “Go ahead.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dutifully, the Count put the spoon in his mouth. In an instant, there was the familiar sweetness of fresh honey—sunlit, golden, and gay. Given the time of year, the Count was expecting this first impression to be followed by a hint of lilacs from the Alexander Gardens or cherry blossoms from the Garden Ring. But as the elixir dissolved on his tongue, the Count became aware of something else entirely. Rather than the flowering trees of central Moscow, the honey had a hint of a grassy riverbank . . . the trace of a summer breeze . . . a suggestion of a pergola. . . . But most of all, there was the unmistakable essence of a thousand apple trees in bloom. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Abram was nodding his head. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Nizhny Novgorod,” he said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">And it was. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Unmistakably so. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“All these years, they must have been listening to us,” Abram added in a whisper. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The Count and the handyman both looked toward the roof’s edge where the bees, having traveled over a hundred miles and applied themselves in willing industry, now wheeled above their hives as pinpoints of blackness, like the inverse of stars. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It was nearly two in the morning when the Count bid Abram goodnight and returned to his bedroom. Taking the gold coin from his pocket, he placed it back on the stack inside the leg of his godfather’s desk—where it would remain untouched for another twenty-eight years. And the following evening at six, when the Boyarsky opened, the Count was the first one through its doors. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p167"></a>“Andrey,” he said to the maître d’. “Can you spare a moment . . . ?” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p168"></a><img class="calibre2" src="index-168_1.jpg"/></p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre4">BOOK THREE</b></p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p169"></a><b class="calibre4">1930</b></p>

<p class="calibre1">Even as he turned the little handle round and round, the room remained under the tenuous authority of sleep. As yet unchallenged, somnolence continued to cast its shadow over sights and sensations, over forms and formulations, over what has been said and what must be done, lending each the insubstantiality of its domain. But when the Count opened the small wooden drawer of the grinder, the world and all it contained were transformed by that envy of the alchemists—the aroma of freshly ground coffee. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In that instant, darkness was separated from light, the waters from the lands, and the heavens from the earth. The trees bore fruit and the woods rustled with the movement of birds and beasts and all manner of creeping things. While closer at hand, a patient pigeon scuffed its feet on the flashing. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Easing the little drawer from the Apparatus, the Count poured its contents into the pot (which he had mindfully primed with water the night before). He lit the burner and shook out the match. As he waited for the coffee to brew, he did thirty squats and thirty stretches and took thirty deep breaths. From the little cupboard in the corner, he took a small pitcher of cream, a pair of English biscuits, and a piece of fruit (today an apple). Then having poured the coffee, he began to enjoy the morning’s sensations to their fullest:</p>
<p class="calibre1">The crisp tartness of the apple . . . </p>
<p class="calibre1">The hot bitterness of the coffee . . . </p>
<p class="calibre1">The savory sweetness of the biscuit with its hint of spoiled butter . . . </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p170"></a>So perfect was the combination that upon finishing, the Count was tempted to crank the crank, quarter the apple, dole out the biscuits, and enjoy his breakfast all over again. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But time and tide wait for no man. So, having poured the remnants of the coffee from its pot, the Count brushed the biscuit crumbs from his plate onto the window ledge for his feathered friend. Then he emptied the little pitcher of cream into a saucer and turned toward the door with the intention of placing it in the hall—and that was when he saw the envelope on the floor. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Someone must have slipped it under his door in the middle of the night. </p>

<p class="calibre1">The Count sat on his bed and took the last sip of coffee. Then he tucked the point of his paring knife under the envelope’s flap, slit it from corner to corner, and gazed within. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“<i class="calibre3">Mon Dieu</i>,” he said. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p171"></a> <i class="calibre3"><b class="calibre4">Arachne’s Art</b></i></p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre4">H</b>istory is the business of identifying momentous events from the comfort of a high-back chair. With the benefit of time, the historian looks back and points to a date in the manner of a gray-haired field marshal pointing to a bend in a river on a map:  <i class="calibre3">There it was, </i> he says.  <i class="calibre3">The turning</i> <i class="calibre3">point. The decisive factor. The fateful day that fundamentally altered all that</i> <i class="calibre3">was to follow. </i></p>

<p class="calibre1">There on the twenty-seventh of May, or there on the sixth of December; at eight or nine in the morning. </p>
<p class="calibre1">There it was, they say. As if—like at the opera—a curtain has closed, a lever has been pulled, one set has been whisked to the rafters and another has dropped to the stage, such that when the curtain opens a moment later the audience will find itself transported from a richly appointed ballroom to the banks of a wooded stream. . . . </p>
<p class="calibre1">But the events that transpired on those various dates did not throw the city of Moscow into upheaval. When the page was torn from the calendar, the bedroom windows did not suddenly shine with the light of a million electric lamps; that Fatherly gaze did not suddenly hang over every desk and appear in every dream; nor did the drivers of a hundred Black Marias turn the keys in their ignitions and fan out into the shadowy streets. For the launch of the First Five-Year Plan, Bukharin’s fall from grace, and the</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p172"></a><img class="calibre2" src="index-172_1.jpg"/></p>
<p class="calibre1">expansion of the Criminal Code to allow the arrest of anyone even countenancing dissension, these were only tidings, omens, underpinnings. </p>
<p class="calibre1">And it would be a decade before their effects were fully felt. </p>
<p class="calibre1">No. For most of us, the late 1920s were not characterized by a series of momentous events. Rather, the passage of those years was like the turn of a kaleidoscope. </p>
<p class="calibre1">At the bottom of a kaleidoscope’s cylinder lie shards of colored glass in random arrangement; but thanks to a glint of sunlight, the interplay of mirrors, and the magic of symmetry, when one peers inside what one finds is a pattern so colorful, so perfectly intricate, it seems certain to have been designed with the utmost care. Then by the slightest turn of the wrist, the shards begin to shift and settle into a new configuration—a configuration with its own symmetry of shapes, its own intricacy of colors, its own hints of design. </p>
<p class="calibre1">So it was in the city of Moscow in the late 1920s. </p>
<p class="calibre1">And so it was at the Metropol Hotel. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In fact, if a seasoned Muscovite were to cross Theatre Square on the last day of spring in 1930, he would find the hotel much as he remembered it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">There on the front steps still stands Pavel Ivanovich in his greatcoat looking as stalwart as ever (though his hip now gives him some trouble on foggy afternoons). On the other side of the revolving doors are the same eager lads in the same blue caps ready to whisk one’s suitcases up the stairs (though they now answer to Grisha and Genya rather than Pasha and Petya). </p>
<p class="calibre1">Vasily, with his uncanny awareness of whereabouts, still mans the concierge’s desk directly across from Arkady, who remains ready to spin the register and offer you a pen. And in the manager’s office, Mr. Halecki still sits behind his spotless desk (though a new assistant manager with the smile of an ecclesiast is prone to interrupt his reveries over the slightest infraction of the hotel’s rules). </p>
<p class="calibre1">In the Piazza, Russians cut from every cloth (or at least those who have access to foreign currency) gather to linger over coffee and happen upon friends. While in the ballroom, the weighty remarks and late arrivals that once characterized the Assemblies now characterize Dinners of State</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p173"></a>(though no one with a penchant for yellow spies from the balcony anymore). </p>
<p class="calibre1">And the Boyarsky? </p>
<p class="calibre1">At two o’clock its kitchen is already in full swing. Along the wooden tables the junior chefs are chopping carrots and onions as Stanislav, the sous-chef, delicately debones pigeons with a whistle on his lips. On the great stoves, eight burners have been lit to simmer sauces, soups, and stews. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The pastry chef, who seems as dusted with flour as one of his rolls, opens an oven door to withdraw two trays of brioches. And in the center of all this activity, with an eye on every assistant and a finger in every pot, stands Emile Zhukovsky, his chopping knife in hand. </p>
<p class="calibre1">If the kitchen of the Boyarsky is an orchestra and Emile its conductor, then his chopping knife is the baton. With a blade two inches wide at the base and ten inches long to the tip, it is rarely out of his hand and never far from reach. Though the kitchen is outfitted with paring knives, boning knives, carving knives, and cleavers, Emile can complete any of the various tasks for which those knives were designed with his ten-inch chopper. With it he can skin a rabbit. He can zest a lemon. He can peel and quarter a grape. He can use it to flip a pancake or stir a soup, and with the stabbing end he can measure out a teaspoon of sugar or a dash of salt. But most of all, he uses it for pointing. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You,” he says to the saucier, waving the point of his chopper. “Are you going to boil that to nothing? What are you going to use it for, eh? To pave roads? To paint icons? </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You,” he says to the conscientious new apprentice at the end of the counter. “What are you doing there? It took less time for that parsley to grow than for you to mince it!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">And on the last day of spring? It is Stanislav who receives the tip of the knife. For in the midst of trimming the fat from racks of lamb, Emile suddenly stops and glares across the table. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You!” he says, pointing the chopper at Stanislav’s nose. “What is that?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Stanislav, a lanky Estonian who has dutifully studied his master’s every move, looks up from his pigeons with startled eyes. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What is what, sir?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What is that you’re whistling?” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p174"></a><img class="calibre2" src="index-174_1.jpg"/></p>
<p class="calibre1">Admittedly, there has been a melody playing in Stanislav’s head—a little something that he had heard the night before while passing the entrance of the hotel’s bar—but he had not been conscious of whistling it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">And now that he faces the chopper, he cannot for the life of him remember what the melody was. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I am not certain,” he confesses. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Not certain! Were you whistling or weren’t you?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes, sir. It was I who must have been whistling. But I assure you it was just a ditty.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Just a ditty?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“A little song.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I know what a ditty is! But under what authority are you whistling one? </p>
<p class="calibre1">Eh? Has the Central Committee made you Commissar of Ditty Whistling? </p>
<p class="calibre1">Is that the Grand Order of Dittyness I see pinned to your chest?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Without looking down, Emile slams his chopper to the counter, splitting a lamb chop from its rack as if he were severing the melody from Stanislav’s memory once and for all. The chef raises his chopper again and points its tip, but before he can elaborate, that door which separates Emile’s kitchen from the rest of the world swings open. It is Andrey, as prompt as ever, with his Book in hand and a pair of spectacles resting on the top of his head. Like a brigand after a skirmish, Emile slips his chopper under the tie of his apron and then looks expectantly at the door, which a moment later swings again. </p>
<p class="calibre1">With the slightest turn of the wrist the shards of glass tumble into a new arrangement. The blue cap of the bellhop is handed from one boy to the next, a dress as yellow as a canary is stowed in a trunk, a little red guidebook is updated with the new names of streets, and through Emile’s swinging door walks Count Alexander Ilyich Rostov—with the white dinner jacket of the Boyarsky draped across his arm. </p>
<p class="calibre1">One minute later, sitting at the table in the little office overlooking the kitchen were Emile, Andrey, and the Count—that Triumvirate which met each day at 2:15 to decide the fate of the restaurant’s staff, its customers, its chickens and tomatoes. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p175"></a>As was customary, Andrey convened the meeting by resting his reading glasses on the tip of his nose and opening the Book. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“There are no parties in the private rooms tonight,” he began, “but every table in the dining room is reserved for two seatings.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Ah,” said Emile with the grim smile of the commander who prefers to be outnumbered. “But you’re not going to rush them, eh?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Absolutely not,” assured the Count. “We’ll simply see to it that their menus are delivered promptly and their orders taken directly.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Emile nodded in acknowledgment. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Are there any complications?” asked the Count of the maître d’. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Nothing out of the ordinary.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Andrey spun the Book so that his headwaiter could see for himself. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The Count ran a finger down the list of reservations. As Andrey had said, there was nothing out of the ordinary. The Commissar of Transport loathed American journalists; the German ambassador loathed the Commissar of Transport; and the deputy head of the OGPU was loathed by all. <a href="index_split_006.html#p458">* The most delicate matter was that two dif</a>ferent members of the Politburo were hosting tables during the second seating. As both were relatively new to their positions, it was not essential that either have the best tables in the house. What  <i class="calibre3">was</i> essential was that their treatment be identical in every respect. They must be served with equal attention at tables of equal size equidistant from the kitchen door. And ideally, they would be on opposite sides of the centerpiece (tonight an arrangement of irises). </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What do you think?” asked Andrey, with his pen in hand. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As the Count made his suggestions of who should sit where, there came a delicate knock on the door. Stanislav entered, carrying a serving bowl and platter. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Good day, gentlemen,” the sous-chef said to Andrey and the Count with a friendly smile. “In addition to our normal fare, tonight we have cucumber soup and—” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes, yes,” said Emile with a scowl. “We know, we know.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Stanislav apologetically placed the bowl and platter on the table, even as Emile waved him from the room. Once he was gone, the chef gestured at the offering. “In addition to our normal fare, tonight we have cucumber soup and rack of lamb with a red wine reduction.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p176"></a>On the table were three teacups. Emile ladled the soup into two of the cups and waited for his colleagues to sample it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Excellent,” said Andrey. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Emile nodded and then turned to the Count with his eyebrows raised. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A puree of peeled cucumber, thought the Count. Yogurt, of course. A bit of salt. Not as much dill as one might expect. In fact, something else entirely . . . Something that speaks just as eloquently of summer’s approach, but with a little more flair . . . </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Mint?” he asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The chef responded with the smile of the bested. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“<i class="calibre3">Bravo</i>,  <i class="calibre3">monsieur</i>.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“. . . To anticipate the lamb,” the Count added with appreciation. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Emile bowed his head once and then, slipping the chopper from his waist, he carved four chops from the rack and stacked two on each of his colleagues’ plates. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The lamb, which had been encrusted with rosemary and breadcrumbs, was savory and tender. Both maître d’ and headwaiter sighed in appreciation. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Thanks to a member of the Central Committee, who had tried unsuccessfully to order a bottle of Bordeaux for the new French ambassador in 1927, wines with labels could once again be found in the Metropol’s cellar (after all, despite its considerable size, the neck of a dragon has been known to whip about like that of an asp). So, turning to the Count, Andrey asked what he thought they should recommend with the lamb. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“For those who can afford it, the Château Latour ’99.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The chef and maître d’ nodded. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“And for those who cannot?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The Count considered. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Perhaps a Côtes du Rhône.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Excellent,” said Andrey. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Picking up his chopper, Emile pointed at the rest of the rack and cautioned the Count: “Tell your boys that my lamb is served rare. If someone wants it medium, they can go to a canteen.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The Count expressed his comprehension and willingness to comply. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Then Andrey closed the Book and Emile wiped his chopper. But as they began pushing back their chairs, the Count remained where he was. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p177"></a>“Gentlemen,” he said. “Just one more thing before we adjourn. . . .” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Given the expression on the Count’s face, the chef and the maître d’</p>
<p class="calibre1">pulled their chairs back to the table. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The Count looked through the window into the kitchen to confirm that the staff were consumed with their work. Then from his jacket pocket he took the envelope that had been slipped under his door. When he tipped it over Emile’s unused teacup, out poured filaments of a red and golden hue. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The three men were silent for a moment. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Emile sat back. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“<i class="calibre3">Bravo</i>,” he said again. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“May I?” asked Andrey. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Certainly.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Andrey picked up the teacup and tipped it back and forth. Then he replaced it so gently on its saucer that the porcelain didn’t make a sound. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Is it enough?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Having watched the filaments spill from the envelope, the chef didn’t need a second look. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Without a doubt.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Do we still have the fennel?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“There are a few bulbs at the back of the larder. We’ll have to discard the outer leaves, but otherwise they’re fine.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Did you hear back about the oranges?” asked the Count. </p>
<p class="calibre1">With a somber look, the chef shook his head. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“How many would we need?” asked Andrey. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Two. Maybe three.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I think I know where some can be found. . . .” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Can they be found today?” asked the chef. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Andrey pulled the pocket watch from his vest and consulted it in the palm of his hand. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“With any luck.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Where would Andrey be able to acquire three oranges on such short notice? Another restaurant? One of the special stores for hard currencies? A patron in the upper echelons of the Party? Well, for that matter, where did the Count acquire an ounce and a half of saffron? Such questions had stopped being asked years ago. Suffice it to say, the saffron was in hand and the oranges within reach. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p178"></a><img class="calibre2" src="index-178_1.jpg"/></p>
<p class="calibre1">The three conspirators exchanged satisfied glances and then pushed back their chairs. Andrey put his glasses back on his head as Emile turned to the Count. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You’ll get the menus in their hands directly and their orders taken promptly, eh? No malingering?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No malingering.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well then,” concluded the chef. “We meet at half past twelve.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">When the Count left the Boyarsky with his white jacket draped across his arm, there was a smile on his lips and a jauntiness to his step. In fact, there was a brightness in his whole demeanor. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Greetings, Grisha,” he said as he passed the bellhop (who was on his way up the stairs with a vase of tiger lilies two feet tall). </p>
<p class="calibre1">“<i class="calibre3">Guten tag</i>,” he said to the lovely young Fraulein in the lavender blouse (who was waiting by the elevator door). </p>
<p class="calibre1">The Count’s good humor was due in part, no doubt, to the reading on the thermometer. Over the previous three weeks, the temperature had climbed four and a half degrees, setting in motion that course of natural and human events which culminates in hints of mint in cucumber soups, lavender blouses at elevator doors, and midday deliveries of tiger lilies two feet tall. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Also lightening his step were the promises of an afternoon assignation and a midnight rendezvous. But the factor that most directly contributed to the Count’s good humor was the double  <i class="calibre3">bravo</i> from Emile. This was something that had occurred only once or twice in four years. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Passing through the lobby, the Count returned the friendly wave from the new fellow at the mail window and hailed Vasily, who was hanging up his phone (having undoubtedly secured another two tickets for some sold-out performance). </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Good afternoon, my friend. Hard at work I see.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">In acknowledgment, the concierge gestured to the lobby, which bustled almost as much as it had in its prewar prime. As if on cue, the telephone on his desk began to ring, the bellhop’s bell triple-chimed, and someone called out, “Comrade! Comrade!” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p179"></a>Ah,  <i class="calibre3"> comrade, </i> thought the Count. Now, there was a word for the ages. . . . </p>
<p class="calibre1">When the Count was a boy in St. Petersburg, one rarely bumped into it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It was always prowling at the back of a mill or under the table in a tavern, occasionally leaving its paw marks on the freshly printed pamphlets that were drying on a basement floor. Now, thirty years later, it was the most commonly heard word in the Russian language. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A wonder of semantic efficiency,  <i class="calibre3">comrade </i> could be used as a greeting, or a word of parting. As a congratulations, or a caution. As a call to action, or a remonstrance. Or it could simply be the means of securing someone’s attention in the crowded lobby of a grand hotel. And thanks to the word’s versatility, the Russian people had finally been able to dispense with tired formalities, antiquated titles, bothersome idioms—even names! Where else in all of Europe could one shout a single word to hail any of one’s countrymen be they male or female, young or old, friend or foe? </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Comrade!” someone called again—this time with a little more urgency. </p>
<p class="calibre1">And then he tugged on the Count’s sleeve. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Startled, the Count turned to find the new fellow from the mail window at his elbow. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well, hello there. How can I be of service to you, young man?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The fellow looked perplexed at the Count’s question, having assumed that it was his position to be of service to someone else. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“There is a letter for you,” he explained. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“For me?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes, comrade. It came yesterday.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The young fellow pointed back toward the window to indicate where the letter remained. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well, in that case, after you,” said the Count. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Civil servant and customer proceeded to their appropriate stations on either side of that small window which separates the written from the read. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Here it is,” he said, after a moment of sorting. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Thank you, my good man.” </p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="p180"></a>When the Count had come down to the lobby from the Boyarsky, he had been on his way to the office of the shy delight, where he hoped to secure a length of white thread for a button that had been compromised on his jacket. But he had not seen Mishka in almost half a year; and at the very moment that he recognized his old friend’s script, a lady with a lapdog rose from his favorite chair between the potted palms. Ever respectful of Fate, the Count postponed his visit to the seamstress, claimed his seat, and opened the letter. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">Leningrad</i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">June 14, 1930</i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">Dear Sasha, </i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">At four this morning, unable to sleep, I ventured out into the old</i> <i class="calibre3">city. As the revelers of the white nights had already stumbled home</i> <i class="calibre3">and the tram conductors had yet to don their caps, I strolled along</i> <i class="calibre3">Nevsky Prospekt through a stillness of spring that seemed stolen from</i> <i class="calibre3">another province, if not another time. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">Nevsky, like the city itself, bears a new name: October 25th</i> <i class="calibre3">Prospekt—a worthy day staking its claim on a storied street. But at</i> <i class="calibre3">this hour, it was just as you remember it, my friend. And with no</i> <i class="calibre3">destination in mind, I crossed the Moika and Fontanka Canals, I</i> <i class="calibre3">passed the shops, and the rose-hued facades of the grand old homes</i> <i class="calibre3">until, at last, I reached Tikhvin Cemetery, where the bodies of</i> <i class="calibre3">Dostoevsky and Tchaikovsky slumber a few feet apart. (Do you</i> <i class="calibre3">remember how late into the night we would debate the genius of the</i> <i class="calibre3">one over the other?)</i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">And suddenly it struck me that walking the length of Nevsky</i> <i class="calibre3">Prospekt was like walking the length of Russian literature. Right</i> <i class="calibre3">there at the beginning—just off the avenue on the Moika embankment</i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">—is the house where Pushkin ended his years. A few paces on are the</i> <i class="calibre3">rooms where Gogol began Dead Souls. Then the National Library,</i> <i class="calibre3">where Tolstoy scoured the archives. And here, behind the cemetery</i> <i class="calibre3">walls, lies brother Fyodor, our restless witness of the human soul</i> <i class="calibre3">entombed beneath the cherry trees. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p181"></a> <i class="calibre3">As I was standing lost in thought, the sun rose above the cemetery</i> <i class="calibre3">walls, shining its light down the Prospekt and, nearly overcome, I</i> <i class="calibre3">recalled that great affirmation, that proclamation, that promise:</i> <i class="calibre3">Always to shine, </i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">to shine everywhere, </i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">to the very depths of the last days . . . </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">Before turning to the second page of his old friend’s letter, the Count found himself looking up, deeply moved. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It was not the memories of St. Petersburg that affected him so—not some nostalgia for his youth among the rose-hued facades, or for his years with Mishka in the apartment above the cobbler’s. Nor was it Mishka’s sentimental reminders of Russia’s literary greatness. What moved the Count was the thought of his old friend venturing out into this stolen spring barely aware of where he was headed. For from the letter’s first line, the Count had known exactly where Mishka was headed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It had been four years since Mishka had moved to Kiev with Katerina; it had been one year since she had left him for another man; and six months since he had returned to St. Petersburg to barricade himself once again behind his books. Then one spring night at four in the morning, unable to sleep, he finds himself on Nevsky Prospekt following the very same route that he had walked with Katerina on the day that she had first taken his hand. And there, as the sun begins to rise, he is overcome with thoughts of an affirmation, a proclamation, a promise—a promise to shine everywhere and always to very depths of the last days—which, after all, is all that anyone has ever asked of love. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As these thoughts passed through the Count’s mind, was he concerned that Mishka still pined for Katerina? Was he concerned that his old friend was morbidly retracing the footsteps of a lapsed romance? </p>
<p class="calibre1">Concerned? Mishka would pine for Katerina the rest of his life! Never again would he walk Nevsky Prospekt, however they chose to rename it, without feeling an unbearable sense of loss. And that is just how it should be. That sense of loss is exactly what we must anticipate, prepare for, and</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p182"></a>cherish to the last of our days; for it is only our heartbreak that finally refutes all that is ephemeral in love. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The Count picked up Mishka’s letter with the intention of reading on, but as he turned the page, three youths leaving the Piazza happened to stop on the other side of one of the potted palms to carry on some weighty conversation. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The trio was made up of a good-looking Komsomol type in his early twenties, and two younger women—one blonde, one brunette. The three were apparently headed for the Ivanovo Province in some official capacity and the young man, who was their captain, now warned his compatriots of the privations they would inevitably face while assuring them of their work’s historical significance. </p>
<p class="calibre1">When he finished, the brunette asked how large the province was, but before he could answer, the blonde obliged: “It is over three hundred square miles with a population of half a million. And while the region is largely agricultural, it has only eight machine tractor stations and six modern mills.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The handsome captain did not seem the least put out by his younger comrade answering on his behalf. On the contrary, it was plain from the expression on his face that he held her in the highest regard. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As the blonde concluded her geography lesson, a fourth member of the party jogged up from the direction of the Piazza. Shorter and younger than the leader, he was wearing the sailor’s cap that had been favored among landlocked youth ever since  <i class="calibre3">Battleship Potemkin</i>. In his hand he had a canvas jacket, which he now held out to the blonde. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I took the liberty of getting your coat,” he said eagerly, “when I picked up mine.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The blonde accepted the coat with a nod, and without a word of thanks. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Without a word of thanks . . . ? </p>
<p class="calibre1">The Count rose to his feet. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Nina?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">All four youths turned toward the potted palm. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Leaving his white jacket and Mishka’s letter in his chair, the Count stepped from behind the fronds. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Nina Kulikova!” he exclaimed. “What a delightful surprise.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p183"></a>And that is exactly what it was for the Count: a delightful surprise. For he had not seen Nina in over two years; and many had been the time that he had passed the card room or the ballroom and found himself wondering where she was and what she was doing. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But in an instant, the Count could see that for Nina his sudden appearance was less opportune. Perhaps she’d rather not have to explain to her comrades about her acquaintance with a Former Person. Perhaps she hadn’t mentioned that she had lived as a child in such a fine hotel. Or perhaps she simply wanted to carry on this purposeful conversation with her purposeful friends. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’ll be just a minute,” she told them, then crossed over to the Count. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Naturally, after such a long separation the Count’s instinct was to embrace little Nina like a bear; but she seemed to dissuade his impulse with her posture. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It is good to see you, Nina.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“And you, Alexander Ilyich.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The old friends took each other in for a moment; then Nina made a gesture toward the white jacket hanging over the arm of the chair. </p>
