<body><p class="calibre1"><a id="p63"></a>about. While tucked away in the corner, looking no worse for wear, were two small oriental rugs, a standing lamp, and the small satinwood bookcase that the Count had abandoned in his old suite. </p>
<p class="calibre1">At the far end of the basement, as the Count and Nina approached the narrow back stair, they passed a bright blue door. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What do we have here?” asked the Count. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nina looked uncharacteristically flummoxed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I don’t think I’ve been inside.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The Count tried the knob. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Ah, well. I’m afraid that it’s locked.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">But Nina looked left and looked right. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The Count followed suit. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Then she raised her hands under her hair and unhooked the delicate chain that she wore around her neck. Dangling at the bottom of the golden parabola was the pendant the Count had first observed at the Piazza, but it was neither a lucky charm nor locket. It was a passkey for the hotel! </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nina slid the key from its chain and handed it to the Count so that he could do the honors. Slipping it through the skull-shaped hole in the escutcheon, the Count turned gently and listened as the tumblers fell into place with a satisfying click. Then he opened the door and Nina gasped, for inside there was a treasure trove. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Quite literally. </p>
<p class="calibre1">On shelves that lined the walls from floor to ceiling was the hotel’s silver service, shimmering as if it had been polished that very morning. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What is it all for?” she asked in amazement. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“For banquets,” replied the Count. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Alongside the stacks of Sèvres plates bearing the hotel’s insignia were samovars that stood two feet tall and soup tureens that looked like the goblets of the gods. There were coffeepots and gravy boats. There was an assortment of utensils, each of which had been designed with the greatest care to serve a single culinary purpose. From among them, Nina picked up what looked like a delicate spade with a plunger and an ivory handle. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Depressing the lever, Nina watched as the two opposing blades opened and shut, then she looked to the Count in wonder. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“An asparagus server,” he explained. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Does a banquet really need an asparagus server?” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p64"></a>“Does an orchestra need a bassoon?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">As Nina returned it gently to the shelf, the Count wondered how many times he had been served by that implement? How many times had he eaten off these plates? The bicentennial of St. Petersburg had been celebrated in the Metropol’s ballroom, as had the centennial of Pushkin’s birth and the annual dinner of the Backgammon Club. And then there were the more intimate gatherings that took place in the two private dining rooms adjacent to the Boyarsky: the Yellow and Red Rooms. In their heyday, these retreats were so conducive to frank expressions of sentiment that if one were to eavesdrop at their tables for a month, one would be able to anticipate all of the bankruptcies, weddings, and wars of the year to come. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The Count let his eyes wander over the shelves, then shook his head to express a sense of mystification. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Nina responded with the unclouded judgment of a child. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Perhaps they need it here.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Yes, thought the Count. That is it precisely <i class="calibre3">. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">For however decisive the Bolsheviks’ victory had been over the privileged classes on behalf of the Proletariat, they would be having banquets soon enough. Perhaps there would not be as many as there had been under the Romanovs—no autumn dances or diamond jubilees—but they were bound to celebrate something, whether the centennial of  <i class="calibre3">Das</i> <i class="calibre3">Kapital</i> or the silver anniversary of Lenin’s beard. Guest lists would be drawn up and shortened. Invitations would be engraved and delivered. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Then, having gathered around a grand circle of tables, the new statesmen would nod their heads in order to indicate to a waiter (without interrupting the long-winded fellow on his feet) that, yes, they would have a few more spears of asparagus. </p>
<p class="calibre1">For pomp is a tenacious force. And a wily one too. </p>
<p class="calibre1">How humbly it bows its head as the emperor is dragged down the steps and tossed in the street. But then, having quietly bided its time, while helping the newly appointed leader on with his jacket, it compliments his appearance and suggests the wearing of a medal or two. Or, having served him at a formal dinner, it wonders aloud if a taller chair might not have been more fitting for a man with such responsibilities. The soldiers of the</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p65"></a><img class="calibre2" src="index-65_1.jpg"/></p>
<p class="calibre1">common man may toss the banners of the old regime on the victory pyre, but soon enough trumpets will blare and pomp will take its place at the side of the throne, having once again secured its dominion over history and kings. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nina was running her fingers over the various serving implements with a blend of admiration and awe. Then she came to a stop. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What is that?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">On the shelf behind a candelabra stood a three-inch-tall woman fashioned from silver with the hooped skirt and towering hair of a Marie Antoinette. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It’s a summoner,” said the Count. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“A summoner?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“To be placed on the table beside the hostess.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The Count picked up the little lady by her bouffant and when he waggled her to and fro, out from under her skirt came that delightful jangle (at a high C) that had prompted the end of a thousand courses and the clearing of fifty thousand plates. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In the days that followed, Nina presented her curriculum systematically, leading her student from room to room <i class="calibre3">. </i> At the onset, the Count had assumed that all their classes would be held on the hotel’s lower levels, where its services were housed. But having visited the basement, the mail room, the switchboard, and all the other nooks of the first floor, one afternoon they proceeded up the staircase to the suites. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Now, admittedly, the exploration of private apartments represents something of a break with decorum, but Nina’s interest in visiting the rooms was not thievery. Nor was it snooping per se. It was the views. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Each of the rooms of the Metropol offered an entirely different perspective—one that was shaped not only by altitude and orientation, but by season and time of day. Thus, if by chance one cared to watch the battalions marching toward Red Square on the Seventh of November, one should go no further than room 322. But when one wished to drop snowballs on unsuspecting strollers, this was best accomplished from the deep-ledged windows of 405. Even room 244, a rather depressing little spot</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p66"></a><img class="calibre2" src="index-66_1.jpg"/></p>
<p class="calibre1"><img class="calibre2" src="index-66_2.jpg"/></p>
<p class="calibre1">overlooking the alley behind the hotel, had its allure: for from there, if one leaned far enough out of the window, one could watch the fruit sellers gather at the kitchen door and catch the occasional apple tossed from below. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But if one wished to watch the arrival of guests at the Bolshoi on a summer night, the best vantage point, without question, was the northwest window of 317. And so . . . </p>
<p class="calibre1">On the twelfth of July at seven o’clock, as the Count was crossing the lobby, Nina caught his eye and gave him the signal. Two minutes later, having joined her on the stairs, he was trailing her past rooms 313, 314, and 315, toward the door of his old suite. And when Nina turned the key and slipped inside, the Count dutifully followed—but with a palpable sense of foreboding. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In a glance the Count reacquainted himself with every inch of the room. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The couch and chairs upholstered in red remained, as did the grandfather clock and the large Chinese urns from Idlehour. On the French coffee table (that had been supplied to replace his grandmother’s) was a folded copy of <i class="calibre3">Pravda</i>, a silver service, and an unfinished cup of tea. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Quick,” she said again, as she padded across the room to the window at the northwest corner. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Across Theatre Square the Bolshoi was lit from portico to pediment. The Bolsheviks who, as usual, were dressed like the cast of  <i class="calibre3">La Bohème</i>, were taking advantage of the warm night air by mingling among the columns. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Suddenly, the lights in the lobby flickered. Scuffing out their cigarettes, the men took their ladies by the elbow. But just as the last of the attendees was disappearing through the doors, a taxi pulled to the curb, the door flung open, and a woman in red dashed up the stairs with the hem of her dress in her hands. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Leaning forward, Nina cupped her palms against the glass and squinted. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“If only I were there and she were here,” she sighed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">And there, thought the Count, was a suitable plaint for all mankind. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p67"></a>Later that night, as he sat alone on his bed, the Count mulled over his visit to his old suite. </p>
<p class="calibre1">What had stayed with him was not the sight of his family’s clock still ticking by the door, nor the grandeur of the architecture, nor even the view from the northwest window. What had lingered with him was the sight of the tea service on the table beside the folded paper. </p>
<p class="calibre1">That little tableaux, for all its innocence, was somehow suggestive of exactly what had been bearing down on the Count’s soul. For he understood every aspect of the scene at a glance. Having returned from some outing at four o’clock and having hung his jacket on the back of a chair, the room’s current resident had called for tea and an afternoon edition. Then he had settled himself down on the couch to while away a civilized hour before it was time to dress for dinner. In other words, what the Count had observed in suite 317 was not simply an afternoon tea, but a moment in the daily life of a gentleman at liberty. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In light of these thoughts, the Count reviewed his new room—the one hundred square feet that had been assigned to him. Never had it seemed so small. The bed crowded the coffee table, the coffee table crowded the high-back chair, and the high-back chair had to be shoved aside every time one wished to open the closet. Simply put, there was not enough space to accommodate such a civilized hour. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But as the Count gazed around him with this forlorn thought, a voice only half his own reminded him that in the Metropol there were rooms behind rooms, and doors behind doors. . . . </p>
<p class="calibre1">Rising from his bed, the Count navigated his way around his grandmother’s coffee table, set aside the high-back chair, and stood before his telephone box of a closet. Running along the perimeter of where the closet met the wall was an elegant molding. The Count had always thought this flourish a little excessive; but what if the closet had been built in an old doorframe? Opening the door, the Count parted his clothes and tentatively rapped on the back wall. The sound was promisingly thin. With three fingers he gave the barrier a push and could feel it flex. He took all his jackets out and dumped them on the bed. Then holding the jambs of the door he kicked the inner wall with his heel. There came a pleasant crack. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Leaning back, he kicked again and again until the barrier splintered. Then he pulled the jagged planks back into his room and slipped through the gap. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p68"></a>He was now inside a dark, narrow space that smelled of dry cedar, presumably the interior of the neighboring closet. Taking a breath, he turned the knob, opened the door, and entered a room that was the mirror image of his own—but in which five unused bedframes had been stored. At some point, two of the frames, which had been leaning against the wall, had fallen, pinning the hallway door shut. Pulling the frames aside, the Count opened the door, dragged everything out of the room, and began to refurnish. </p>
<p class="calibre1">First, he reunited the two high-back chairs with his grandmother’s coffee table. Then, taking the belfry stairs, he went down to the basement. From the cabinet of curiosities, he retrieved one of his rugs, the standing lamp, and the small bookcase in three separate trips. Then vaulting the steps two at a time, he made one final visit in order to claim ten of the weighty novels that had been abandoned. Once his new study was furnished, he went down the hall and borrowed the roofer’s hammer and five nails. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The Count had not wielded a hammer since he was a boy at Idlehour when he would help Tikhon, the old caretaker, repair the fencing in the first weeks of spring. What a fine feeling it had been to bring the hammer down squarely on the head of a nail, driving it through a plank into a fence post as the impact echoed in the morning air. But on the very first stroke of this hammer what the Count squarely hit was the back of his thumb. (Lest you have forgotten, it is quite excruciating to hammer the back of your thumb. It inevitably prompts a hopping up and down and the taking of the Lord’s name in vain.)</p>

<p class="calibre1">Suffice it to say that within half an hour four of the nails had been driven through the edge of the door into the doorframe—such that from that moment forward the only access to the Count’s new room would be through the sleeves of his jackets. The fifth nail he saved for the wall above the bookcase so that he could hang the portrait of his sister. </p>
<p class="calibre1">His work completed, the Count sat down in one of the high-back chairs and felt an almost surprising sense of bliss. The Count’s bedroom and this</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p69"></a>improvised study had identical dimensions, and yet, they exerted a completely different influence on his mood. To some degree, this difference stemmed from the manner in which the two rooms had been furnished. For while the room next door—with its bed, bureau, and desk—remained a realm of practical necessities, the study—with its books, the Ambassador, and Helena’s portrait—had been furnished in a manner more essential to the spirit. But in all likelihood, a greater factor in the difference between the two rooms was their provenance. For if a room that exists under the governance, authority, and intent of others seems smaller than it is, then a room that exists in  <i class="calibre3">secret</i> can, regardless of its dimensions, seem as vast as one cares to imagine. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Rising from his chair, the Count took up the largest of the ten volumes that he had retrieved from the basement. True, it would not be a new venture for him. But need it be? Could one possibly accuse him of nostalgia or idleness, of wasting his time simply because he had read the story two or three times before? </p>
<p class="calibre1">Sitting back down, the Count put one foot on the edge of the coffee table and tilted back until his chair was balanced on its two hind legs, then he turned to the opening sentence:</p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">All happy families are alike; each unhappy family is unhappy</i> <i class="calibre3">in its own way. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">“Marvelous,” said the Count. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p70"></a> <i class="calibre3"><b class="calibre4">An Assembly</b></i></p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre4">O</b>h, come along.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’d rather not.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Don’t be such a fuddy-duddy.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I am not a fuddy-duddy.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Can you be so sure?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“A man can never be entirely sure that he is not a fuddy-duddy. That is axiomatic to the term.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Exactly.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">In this manner, Nina coerced the Count to join her on one of her favorite excursions: spying from the balcony of the ballroom. The Count was reluctant to accompany Nina on this particular journey for two reasons. </p>
<p class="calibre1">First, the ballroom’s balcony was narrow and dusty, and to stay out of sight one was forced to remain hunched behind the balustrade—a decidedly uncomfortable position for a grown man over six feet tall. (The last time the Count had accompanied Nina to the balcony, he had torn the seam of his pants and it took three days for him to lose the crick in his neck.) But second, this afternoon’s gathering was almost certain to be another Assembly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Over the course of the summer, the Assemblies had been occurring at the hotel with increasing frequency. At various times of day, small groups of men would come barreling through the lobby, already gesticulating, interrupting, and eager to make their points. In the ballroom, they would join their brethren milling shoulder to shoulder, every other one of them puffing on a cigarette. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As best as the Count could determine, the Bolsheviks assembled whenever possible in whichever form for whatever reason. In a single week, there might be committees, caucuses, colloquiums, congresses, and conventions variously coming together to establish codes, set courses of</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p71"></a><img class="calibre2" src="index-71_1.jpg"/></p>
<p class="calibre1">action, levy complaints, and generally clamor about the world’s oldest problems in its newest nomenclature. </p>
<p class="calibre1">If the Count was reluctant to observe these gatherings, it was not because he found the ideological leanings of the attendees distasteful. He would no sooner have crouched behind a balustrade to watch Cicero debating Catiline, or Hamlet debating himself. No, it was not a matter of ideology. Simply put, the Count found political discourse of any persuasion to be tedious. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But then, wasn’t that exactly what a fuddy-duddy would argue . . . ? </p>
<p class="calibre1">Needless to say, the Count followed Nina up the stairs to the second floor. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Having skirted the entrance to the Boyarsky and ensured the coast was clear, they used Nina’s key to open the unmarked door to the balcony. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Down below, a hundred men were already in their chairs and another hundred were conferring in the aisles as three impressive fellows took their seats behind a long wooden table on the dais. Which is to say, the Assembly had nearly Assembled. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As this was the second of August and there had already been two Assemblies earlier that day, the temperature in the ballroom was 91˚. Nina skirted out behind the balustrade on her hands and knees. When the Count bent over to do the same, the seam in the back of his pants gave way again. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“<i class="calibre3">Merde</i>,” he muttered. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Shh,” said Nina. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The first time the Count had joined Nina on the balcony, he couldn’t help but feel some astonishment at how profoundly the life of the ballroom had changed. Not ten years before, all of Moscow society would have been gathered in their finery under the grand chandeliers to dance the mazurka and toast the Tsar. But after witnessing a few of the Assemblies, the Count had come to an even more astonishing conclusion: that despite the Revolution, the room had barely changed at all. </p>
<p class="calibre1">At that very moment, for example, two young men were coming through the doors looking game for the fray; but before exchanging a word with a soul, they crossed the room in order to pay their respects to an old man seated by the wall. Presumably, this elder had taken part in the 1905</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p72"></a>revolution, or penned a pamphlet in 1880, or dined with Karl Marx back in 1852. Whatever his claim to eminence, the old revolutionary acknowledged the deference of the two young Bolsheviks with a self-assured nod of the head—all the while sitting in the very chair from which the Grand Duchess Anapova had received the greetings of dutiful young princes at her annual Easter Ball. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Or consider the charming-looking chap who, in the manner of Prince Tetrakov, was now touring the room, shaking hands and patting backs. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Having systematically made an impression in every corner—with a weighty remark here and a witty remark there—he now excused himself “for just a moment.” But once through the door, he will not reappear. For having ensured that everyone in the ballroom has noted his attendance, he will now head off to an altogether different sort of Assembly—one that is to take place in a cozy little room in the Arbat. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Later, no doubt, some dashing young Turk who is rumored to have Lenin’s ear will make a point of arriving when the business of the evening is nearly done—just as Captain Radyanko had when he had the ear of the Tsar—thus exhibiting his indifference to the smaller conventions of etiquette while reinforcing his reputation as a man with so much to attend to and so little time to attend to it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Of course, there is now more canvas than cashmere in the room, more gray than gold. But is the patch on the elbow really that much different from the epaulette on the shoulder? Aren’t those workaday caps donned, like the bicorne and shako before them, in order to strike a particular note? </p>
<p class="calibre1">Or take that bureaucrat on the dais with his gavel. Surely, he can afford a tailored jacket and a creased pair of pants. If he is wearing this ragged fare, it is in order to assure all assembled that he too is a hardened member of the working class! </p>
<p class="calibre1">As if hearing the Count’s thoughts, this Secretary suddenly rapped his gavel on the tabletop—calling to order the Second Meeting of the First Congress of the Moscow Branch of the All-Russian Union of Railway Workers. The doors were closed, seats were taken, Nina held her breath, and the Assembly was underway. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In the first fifteen minutes, six different administrative matters were raised and dispensed with in quick succession—leading one to imagine that this particular Assembly might actually be concluded before one’s back</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p73"></a>gave out. But next on the docket was a subject that proved more contentious. It was a proposal to amend the Union’s charter—or more precisely, the seventh sentence of the second paragraph, which the Secretary now read in full. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Here, indeed, was a formidable sentence—one that was on intimate terms with the comma, and that held the period in healthy disregard. For its apparent purpose was to catalog without fear or hesitation every single virtue of the Union including but not limited to: its unwavering shoulders, its undaunted steps, the clanging of its hammers in summer, the shoveling of its coal in winter, and the hopeful sound of its whistles in the night. But in the concluding phrases of this impressive sentence, at the very culmination as it were, was the observation that through their tireless efforts, the Railway Workers of Russia “facilitate communication and trade across the provinces <i class="calibre3">. </i>” </p>
<p class="calibre1">After all the buildup, it was a bit of an anticlimax, conceded the Count. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But the objection being raised was not due to the phrase’s overall lack of verve; rather it was due to the word  <i class="calibre3">facilitate</i>. Specifically, the verb had been accused of being so tepid and prim that it failed to do justice to the labors of the men in the room. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We’re not helping a lady put on her jacket!” someone shouted from the rear. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Or painting her nails!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Hear, hear!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Well, fair enough. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But what verb would better express the work of the Union? What verb would do justice to the sweaty devotion of the engineers, the unflagging vigilance of the brakemen, and the rippling muscles of those who laid the tracks? </p>
<p class="calibre1">A flurry of proposals came from the floor:</p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">To spur. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">To propel. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">To empower. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">The merits and limitations of each of these alternatives were hotly debated. There were three-pointed arguments counted out on fingertips, rhetorical questions, emotional summations, and back-row catcalls</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p74"></a><img class="calibre2" src="index-74_1.jpg"/></p>
<p class="calibre1">punctuated by the banging of the gavel—as the ambient temperature of the balcony rose to 96˚. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Then, just as the Count began to sense some risk of riot, a suggestion came from a shy-looking lad in the tenth row that perhaps  <i class="calibre3">to</i> <i class="calibre3">facilitate</i> could be replaced with  <i class="calibre3">to enable and ensure</i>. This pairing, the lad explained (while his cheeks grew red as a raspberry), might encompass not only the laying of rails and the manning of engines, but the ongoing maintenance of the system. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes, that’s it.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Laying, manning, and maintenance.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“To enable and ensure.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">With hearty applause from every corner, the lad’s proposal seemed to be barreling toward adoption as quickly and dependably as one of the Union’s locomotives barrels across the steppe. But just as it was nearing its terminus, a rather scrawny fellow in the second row stood. Such a wisp of a man was he that one wondered how he had secured a position in the Union in the first place. Once he had the attention of the room, this back-office clerk or accountant, this All-Russian pusher of pencils, asserted in a voice as tepid and prim as the word  <i class="calibre3">facilitate</i>: “Poetic concision demands the avoidance of a pair of words when a single word will suffice.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What’s that?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What did he say?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Several stood up with the intention of grabbing him by the collar and dragging him from the room. But before they could get their hands on him, a burly fellow in the fifth row spoke without rising to his feet. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“With all due respect to  <i class="calibre3">poetic concision</i>, the male of the species was endowed with a pair when a single might have sufficed.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Thunderous applause! </p>
<p class="calibre1">The resolution to replace  <i class="calibre3">facilitate</i> with  <i class="calibre3">enable</i> <i class="calibre3">and</i> <i class="calibre3">ensure</i> was adopted by a unanimous show of hands and a universal stomping of feet. While in the balcony, a private acknowledgment was made that perhaps political discourse wasn’t always so dull, after all. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p75"></a><img class="calibre2" src="index-75_1.jpg"/></p>

<p class="calibre1">But by a stroke of luck, he didn’t get the chance. For when Nina asked what he thought of the Assembly, unable to wait even a moment for his impressions, she barreled ahead with her own. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Wasn’t that fascinating? Wasn’t it fantastic? Have you ever been on a train?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The train is my preferred means of travel,” said the Count, somewhat startled. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She nodded enthusiastically. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Mine as well. And when you have traveled by train, have you watched the landscape rolling past the windows, and listened to the conversations of your fellow passengers, and drifted off to the clacking of the wheels?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I have done all of those things.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Exactly. But have you ever, for even one moment, considered how the coal finds its way into the locomotive’s engine? Have you considered in the middle of a forest or on a rocky slope how the tracks came to be there in the first place?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The Count paused. Considered. Imagined. Admitted. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Never.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">She gave him a knowing look. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Isn’t it astounding.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">And when seen in that light, who could disagree? </p>
<p class="calibre1">A few minutes later, the Count was knocking on the office door of Marina, the shy delight, while holding a folded newpaper at the back of his pants. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p76"></a>Not long ago, the Count recalled, there had been three seamstresses at work in this room, each before an American-made sewing machine. Like the three Fates, together they had spun and measured and cut—taking in gowns, raising hems, and letting out pants with all of the fateful implications of their predecessors. In the aftermath of the Revolution, all three had been discharged; the silenced sewing machines had, presumably, become the property of the People; and the room? It had been idled like Fatima’s flower shop. For those had not been years for the taking in of gowns or the raising of hems any more than they had been for the throwing of bouquets or the sporting of boutonnieres. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Then in 1921, confronted with a backlog of fraying sheets, tattered curtains, and torn napkins—which no one had any intention of replacing—</p>
<p class="calibre1">the hotel had promoted Marina, and once again a trustworthy seam was being sewn within the walls of the hotel. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Ah, Marina,” said the Count when she opened the door with needle and thread in hand. “How good to find you stitching away in the stitching room.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Marina looked at the Count with a touch of suspicion. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What else would I be doing?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Quite so,” said the Count. Then offering his most endearing smile, he turned ninety degrees, briefly lifted the newspaper, and humbly asked for her assistance. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Didn’t I repair a pair of your pants just last week?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I was spying with Nina again,” he explained. “From the balcony of the ballroom.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The seamstress looked at the Count with one eye expressing consternation and the other disbelief. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“If you’re going to clamber about with a nine-year-old girl, then why do you insist upon wearing pants like those?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The Count was a little taken aback by the seamstress’s tone. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“When I dressed this morning, it was not my plan to go clambering about. But either way, I’ll have you know that these pants were custom-made on Savile Row.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes. Custom-made for sitting in a sitting room, or drawing in a drawing room.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But I have never drawn in a drawing room.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p77"></a><img class="calibre2" src="index-77_1.jpg"/></p>
<p class="calibre1">“Which is just as well, since you probably would have spilled the ink.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">As Marina seemed neither particularly shy nor delightful that day, the Count offered her the bow of one who would now be on his way. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh, enough of that,” she said. “Behind the screen and off with your pants.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Without another word the Count went behind the dressing screen, stripped to his shorts, and handed Marina his pants. From the ensuing silence, he could tell that she had found her spool, licked her thread, and was carefully directing it through the eye of the needle. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well,” she said, “you might as well tell me what you were doing up in the balcony.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">So, as Marina began stitching the Count’s pants—the laying of locomotive tracks writ small, if you will—he described the Assembly and all his various impressions. Then, almost wistfully, he noted that even as he was seeing the intractability of social conventions and the human tendency to take itself too seriously, Nina was becoming enthralled by the Assembly’s energy and its sense of purpose. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“And what is wrong with that?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Nothing, I suppose,” admitted the Count. “It’s just that only a few weeks ago, she was inviting me to tea in order to ask about the rules of being a princess. . . .” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Handing the Count’s pants back over the screen, Marina shook her head like one who must now deliver a hard truth to an innocent of mind. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“All little girls outgrow their interest in princesses,” she said. “In fact, they outgrow their interest in princesses faster than little boys outgrow their interest in clambering about.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">When the Count left Marina’s office with a thanks, a wave, and the seat of his pants intact, he practically fell over one of the bellhops, who happened to be standing outside the door. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Excuse me, Count Rostov!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That’s quite all right, Petya. No need to apologize. It was my fault, I’m sure.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p78"></a>The poor lad, who looked positively wide-eyed, hadn’t even noticed that he’d lost his cap. So, picking it up from the floor and placing it back on the bellhop’s head, the Count wished him God’s speed in his business and turned to go. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But my business is with  <i class="calibre3">you</i>.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“With me?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It is Mr. Halecki. He wishes to have a word. In his office.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">No wonder the lad was wide-eyed. Not only had the Count never been summoned by Mr. Halecki, in the four years that he had been in residence in the Metropol he had not  <i class="calibre3">seen</i> the manager on more than five occasions. </p>
<p class="calibre1">For Jozef Halecki was one of those rare executives who had mastered the secret of delegation—that is, having assigned the oversight of the hotel’s various functions to capable lieutenants, he made himself scarce. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Arriving at the hotel at half past eight, he would head straight to his office with a harried expression, as if he were already late for a meeting. Along the way, he would return greetings with an abbreviated nod, and when he passed his secretary he would inform her (while still in motion) that he was not to be disturbed. Then he would disappear behind his door. </p>
<p class="calibre1">And what happened once he was inside his office? </p>
<p class="calibre1">It was hard to tell, since so few had ever seen it. (Although, those who had caught a glimpse reported that his desk was impressively free of papers, his telephone rarely rang, and along the wall was a burgundy chaise with cushions that were deeply impressed. . . .)</p>
<p class="calibre1">When the manager’s lieutenants had no choice but to knock—due to a fire in the kitchen or a dispute about a bill—the manager would open his door with an expression of such fatigue, such disappointment, such moral defeat that the interrupters would inevitably feel a surge of sympathy, assure him that they could see to the matter themselves, then apologetically back out the door. As a result, the Metropol ran as flawlessly as any hotel in Europe. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Needless to say, the Count was both anxious and intrigued by the manager’s sudden desire to see him. Without further ado, Petya led him down the hall, through the hotel’s back offices, and finally to the manager’s door, which predictably was closed. Expecting Petya to formally announce him, the Count paused a few feet short of the office, but the bellhop made a sheepish gesture toward the door and then vanished. With no clear</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p79"></a>alternative, the Count knocked. There followed a brief rustling, a moment of silence, and a beleaguered call to come in. </p>
<p class="calibre1">When the Count opened the door, he found Mr. Halecki seated at his desk with a pen firmly in hand, but without a piece of paper in sight. And though the Count was not one to draw conclusions, he did note that the manager’s hair was matted on one side of his head and his reading glasses were crooked on his nose. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You wished to see me?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Ah. Count Rostov. Please. Come in.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">As the Count approached one of the two empty chairs that faced the desk, he noted that hanging above the burgundy chaise was a lovely series of hand-tinted engravings depicting hunting scenes in the English style. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Those are excellent specimens,” said the Count as he took his seat. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What’s that? Oh, yes. The prints. Quite excellent. Yes.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">But having said this, the manager removed his glasses and ran a hand over his eyes. Then he shook his head and sighed. And as he did so, the Count felt a welling of that famed sympathy. “How can I be of service to you?” asked the Count, on the edge of his seat. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The manager gave a nod of familiarity, having presumably heard this question a thousand times before, then put both hands on his desk. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Count Rostov,” he began. “You have been a guest of this hotel for many years. In fact, I gather your first visit here dates back to the days of my predecessor. . . .” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That’s right,” the Count confirmed with a smile. “It was in August 1913.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Quite so.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Room 215, I believe.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Ah. A delightful room.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The two men were silent. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It has been brought to my attention,” the manager continued, if somewhat haltingly, “that various members of the staff when speaking to you . . . have continued to make use of certain . . . honorifics.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Honorifics?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes. More precisely, I gather they have been addressing you as  <i class="calibre3">Your</i> <i class="calibre3">Excellency</i>. . . .” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The Count considered the manager’s assertion for a moment. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p80"></a>“Well, yes. I suppose that some of your staff address me in that fashion.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The manager nodded his head then smiled a little sadly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’m sure you can see the position that this puts me in.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">In point of fact, the Count could not see the position that this put the manager in. But given the Count’s unmitigated feelings of sympathy, he decidedly did not want to put him in any position. So, he listened attentively as Mr. Halecki went on:</p>
<p class="calibre1">“If it were up to me, of course, it goes without saying. But what with . . .” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Here, just when the manager might have pinpointed the most specific of causes, he instead gave an indefinite twirl of the hand and let his voice drift off. Then he cleared his throat. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Naturally, I have little choice but to insist that my staff refrain from using such terms when addressing you. After all, I think we can agree without exaggeration or fear of contradiction that the times have changed.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">In concluding thus, the manager looked to the Count so hopefully, that the Count took immediate pains to reassure him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It is the business of the times to change, Mr. Halecki. And it is the business of gentlemen to change with them.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The manager looked to the Count with an expression of profound gratitude—that someone should understand what he had said so perfectly no further explication was required. </p>
<p class="calibre1">There was a knock at the door and it opened to reveal Arkady, the hotel’s desk captain. The manager’s shoulders slumped at the sight of him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He gestured toward the Count. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“As you can see, Arkady, I am in the midst of a conversation with one of our guests.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“My apologies, Mr. Halecki, Count Rostov.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Arkady bowed to both men, but did not retreat. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“All right then,” said the manager. “What is it?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Arkady gave a slight gesture of the head to suggest that what he had to relate might best be related in private. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Very well.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pushing himself up with both hands, the manager shuffled past his desk, out into the hall, and closed the door, such that the Count found himself alone. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p81"></a> <i class="calibre3">Your Excellency</i>, the Count reflected philosophically.  <i class="calibre3">Your Eminence,</i> <i class="calibre3">Your Holiness, Your Highness</i>. Once upon a time, the use of such terms was a reliable indication that one was in a civilized country. But now, what with . . . </p>
<p class="calibre1">Here, the Count gave an indefinite twirl of the hand. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well. It is probably for the best,” he said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Then rising from his chair, he approached the engravings, which upon closer inspection depicted three phases of a foxhunt: “The Scent,” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Tallyho,” and “The Chase.” In the second print, a young man in stiff black boots and a bright red jacket was blowing on a brass horn that turned a full 360 degrees from its mouthpiece to its bell. Without a doubt, the horn was a carefully crafted object expressive of beauty and tradition, but was it essential to the modern world? For that matter, did we really need a crew of nattily dressed men, purebred horses, and well-trained dogs to corner a fox in a hole? Without exaggeration or fear of contradiction, the Count could answer his own question in the negative. </p>
<p class="calibre1">For the times do, in fact, change. They change relentlessly. Inevitably. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Inventively. And as they change, they set into bright relief not only outmoded honorifics and hunting horns, but silver summoners and mother-of-pearl opera glasses and all manner of carefully crafted things that have outlived their usefulness. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Carefully crafted things that have outlived their usefulness, thought the Count. I wonder . . . </p>
<p class="calibre1">Moving quietly across the room, the Count put an ear to the door, where he could hear the voices of the manager, Arkady, and a third party talking outside. Though muted, their tones suggested they were still a few steps from resolution. Quickly, the Count returned to the wall with the etchings and counted two panels beyond the depiction of “The Chase.” Placing his hand in the center of the panel, he gave a firm push. The panel depressed slightly. When a click sounded, the Count pulled back his fingers and the panel popped open, revealing a hidden cabinet. Inside, just as the Grand Duke had described, was an inlaid box with brass fittings. Reaching into the cabinet, the Count gently lifted the lid of the box and there they were, perfectly crafted and peacefully at rest. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Marvelous,” he said. “Simply marvelous.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p82"></a> <i class="calibre3"><b class="calibre4">Archeologies</b></i></p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre4">P</b>ick a card,” the Count was saying to the smallest of the three ballerinas. </p>


<p class="calibre1">With that in mind, perhaps the Count should have warned them. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But freedom of the will has been a well-established tenet of moral philosophy since the time of the Greeks. And though the Count’s days of romancing were behind him, it goes against the nature of even the well-meaning gentleman to recommend that lovely young ladies leave his company on the basis of hypotheses. </p>
<p class="calibre1">So, instead, the Count remarked on the young ladies’ beauty, inquired what brought them to Moscow, congratulated them on their achievements, insisted upon paying for their wine, chatted with them about their hometowns, and eventually offered to perform a sleight of hand. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p83"></a>A deck of cards with the Metropol’s insignia was produced by the ever-attentive Audrius. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It has been years since I have done this trick,” the Count admitted, “so you must bear with me.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">As he began to shuffle the pack, the three ballerinas watched him closely; but like demigods of ancient myth, they watched in three different ways: the first through the eyes of the innocent, the second through the eyes of the romantic, and the third through the eyes of the skeptic. It was the dove with the innocent eyes whom the Count had asked to pick a card. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As the ballerina was making her selection, the Count became aware of someone standing behind his shoulder, but this was to be expected. In the setting of a bar, a sleight of hand will inevitably attract a curious onlooker or two. But when he turned to his left to offer a wink, he found not a curious onlooker, but unflappable Arkady—looking unusually flapped. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Pardon me, Count Rostov. I am sorry to interrupt. But may I have a moment?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Certainly, Arkady.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Smiling apologetically to the ballerinas, the desk captain led the Count a few paces away, then let the facts of the evening speak for themselves: At half past six, a gentleman had knocked at the suite of Secretary Tarakovsky. </p>
<p class="calibre1">When the esteemed Secretary opened the door, this gentleman demanded to know who he was and what he was doing there! Taken aback, comrade Tarakovsky explained that he was the current resident of the suite and  <i class="calibre3">that</i> was what he was doing there. Unconvinced by this logic, the gentleman insisted he be admitted at once. When comrade Tarakovsky refused, the gentleman brushed him aside, crossed the threshold, and commenced searching the rooms one by one, including, ahem, the  <i class="calibre3">salle de bain</i>—where Mrs. Tarakovsky was seeing to her nightly  <i class="calibre3">toilette</i>. </p>
<p class="calibre1">This was the point at which Arkady had arrived on the scene, having been summoned urgently by phone. In an agitated state, comrade Tarakovsky waved his cane and demanded “as a regular guest of the Metropol and senior member of the Party” to see the manager at once. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The gentleman, who was now sitting on the couch with his arms crossed, replied that this suited him perfectly—as he had been about to summon the manager himself. And as to Party membership, he asserted that <i class="calibre3">he</i> had been a member of the Party since before comrade Tarakovsky was</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p84"></a><img class="calibre2" src="index-84_1.jpg"/></p>
<p class="calibre1">born—which seemed a rather incredible claim given that comrade Tarakovsky is eighty-two. . . . </p>
<p class="calibre1">Now, the Count, who had listened with interest to every word that Arkady had related, would be the first to admit that this was an enthralling tale. In fact, it was just the sort of colorful incident that an international hotel should aspire to have as part of its lore and that he, as a guest of the hotel, would be likely to retell at the first opportunity. But what he could not understand was why Arkady had chosen this particular moment to share this particular story with  <i class="calibre3">him</i>. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Why, because comrade Tarakovsky is staying in suite 317; and it is you for whom the gentleman in question was looking.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Me?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I am afraid so.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What is his name?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“He refused to say.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">. . . </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Then where is he now?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Arkady pointed toward the lobby. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“He is wearing out the carpet behind the potted palms.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Wearing out the carpet . . . ?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The Count stuck his head out of the Shalyapin as Arkady leaned cautiously behind him. And sure enough, there on the other side of the lobby was the gentleman in question, making quick business of the ten feet between the pair of plants. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The Count smiled. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Though a few pounds heavier, Mikhail Fyodorovich Mindich had the same ragged beard and restless pace that he had had when they were twenty-two. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Do you know him?” asked the desk captain. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Only like a brother.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">When the Count and Mikhail Fyodorovich first met at the Imperial University in St. Petersburg in the fall of 1907, the two were tigers of a very different stripe. While the Count had been raised in a twenty-room mansion</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p85"></a>with a staff of fourteen, Mikhail had been raised in a two-room apartment with his mother. And while the Count was known in all the salons of the capital as one who could be counted on for his wit, intelligence, and charm, Mikhail was known hardly anywhere as one who preferred to read in his room rather than fritter away the evening on frivolous conversations. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As such, the two young men hardly seemed fated for friendship. But Fate would not have the reputation it has if it simply did what it seemed it would do. Sure enough, while Mikhail was prone to throw himself into a scrape at the slightest difference of opinion, regardless of the number or size of his opponents, it just so happened that Count Alexander Rostov was prone to leap to the defense of an outnumbered man regardless of how ill conceived his cause. Thus, on the fourth day of their first year, the two students found themselves helping each other up off the ground, as they wiped the dust from their knees and the blood from their lips. </p>
<p class="calibre1">While the splendors that elude us in youth are likely to receive our casual contempt in adolescence and our measured consideration in adulthood, they forever hold us in their thrall. Thus, in the days that followed their meeting, the Count listened with as much amazement to Mikhail’s impassioned expression of ideals, as Mikhail did to the Count’s descriptions of the city’s salons. And within the year, they were sharing rented rooms above a cobbler’s shop off Sredny Prospekt. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As the Count would later observe, it was fortuitous that they ended up above a cobbler—for no one in all of Russia could wear out a shoe like Mikhail Mindich. He could easily pace twenty miles in a twenty-foot room. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He could pace thirty miles in an opera box and fifty in a confessional. For simply put, pacing was Mishka’s natural state. </p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="p86"></a><img class="calibre2" src="index-86_1.jpg"/></p>
<p class="calibre1">beyond the fiftieth page, he had worn out more shoe leather than a pilgrim on the road to St. Paul’s. </p>
<p class="calibre1">So, the storming of hotel suites and the wearing out of carpets was not particularly out of character for his old friend. But as Mishka had recently received a new appointment at their alma mater in St. Petersburg, the Count was surprised to have him appear so suddenly, and in such a state. </p>
<p class="calibre1">After embracing, the two men climbed the five flights to the attic. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Having been told what to expect, Mishka took in his friend’s new circumstances without an expression of surprise. But he paused before the three-legged bureau and tilted his head to give its base a second look. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The  <i class="calibre3">Essays</i> of Montaigne?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes,” affirmed the Count. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I gather they didn’t agree with you.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“On the contrary. I found them to be the perfect height. But tell me, my friend, what brings you to Moscow?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Nominally, Sasha, I am here to help plan the inaugural congress of RAPP, which is to be held in June. But of greater consequence . . .” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Here Mishka reached into a shoulder satchel and produced a bottle of wine with an image of two crossed keys embossed in the glass above the label. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I hope I am not too late.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The Count took the bottle in hand. He ran his thumb over the surface of the insignia. Then he shook his head with the smile of the deeply moved. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No, Mishka. As always, you are right on time.” Then he led his old friend through his jackets. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As the Count excused himself to rinse a pair of glasses from the Ambassador, Mishka surveyed his friend’s study with a sympathetic gaze. </p>
<p class="calibre1">For the tables, the chairs, the  <i class="calibre3">objets d’art</i>, he recognized them all. And well he knew that they had been culled from the halls of Idlehour as reminders of Elysian days. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It must have been in 1908 that Alexander began inviting him to Idlehour for the month of July. Having traveled from St. Petersburg by a series of consecutively smaller trains, they would finally arrive at that little halt in</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p87"></a>the high grass on the branch line, where they would be met by a Rostov coach-and-four. With their bags on top, the driver in the carriage, and Alexander at the reins, they would charge across the countryside waving at every peasant girl until they turned onto the road lined with apple trees that led to the family seat. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As they shed their coats in the entry hall, their bags would be whisked to the grand bedrooms of the east wing, where velvet cords could be pulled to summon a cold glass of beer, or hot water for a bath. But first, they would proceed to the drawing room where—at this very table with its red pagoda</p>
<p class="calibre1">—the Countess would be hosting some blue-blooded neighbor for tea. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Invariably dressed in black, the Countess was one of those dowagers whose natural independence of mind, authority of age, and impatience with the petty made her the ally of all irreverent youth. She would not only abide, but enjoyed when her grandson would interrupt polite conversation to question the standing of the church or the ruling class. And when her guest grew red and responded in a huff, the Countess would give Mishka a conspiratorial wink, as if they stood arm in arm in the battle against boorish decorum and the outmoded attitudes of the times. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Having paid their respects to the Countess, Mishka and Alexander would head out the terrace doors in search of Helena. Sometimes they would find her under the pergola overlooking the gardens and sometimes under the elm tree at the bend in the river; but wherever they found her, at the sound of their approach she would look up from her book and offer a welcoming smile—not unlike the one captured in this portrait on the wall. </p>
<p class="calibre1">With Helena, Alexander was always his most outlandish, claiming as he collapsed on the grass that they had just met Tolstoy on the train; or that he had decided after careful consideration to join a monastery and take an eternal vow of silence. Immediately. Without a moment’s delay. Or, as soon as they’d had lunch. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Do you really think that silence would suit you?” Helena would ask. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Like deafness suited Beethoven.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Then, after casting a friendly glance at Mishka, Helena would laugh, look back at her brother, and ask, “What is to become of you, Alexander?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">They all asked that question of the Count. Helena, the Countess, the Grand Duke.  <i class="calibre3">What is to become of you, Alexander? </i> But they asked it in three different ways. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p88"></a>For the Grand Duke the question was, of course, rhetorical. Confronted with a report of a failed semester or an unpaid bill, the Grand Duke would summon his godson to his library, read the letter aloud, drop it on his desk, and ask the question without expectation of a response, knowing full well that the answer was imprisonment, bankruptcy, or both. </p>
<p class="calibre1">For his grandmother, who tended to ask the question when the Count had said something particularly scandalous,  <i class="calibre3">What is to become of you</i>, <i class="calibre3">Alexander? </i> was an admission to all in earshot that here was her favorite, so you needn’t expect  <i class="calibre3">her</i> to rein in his behavior. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But when Helena asked the question, she did so as if the answer were a genuine mystery. As if, despite her brother’s erratic studies and carefree ways, the world had yet to catch a glimpse of the man he was bound to become. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What is to become of you, Alexander?” Helena would ask. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That is the question,” the Count would agree. And then he would lie back in the grass and gaze thoughtfully at the figure eights of the fireflies as if he too were pondering this essential enigma. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Yes, those were Elysian days, thought Mishka. But like Elysium they belonged in the past. They belonged with waistcoats and corsets, with quadrilles and bezique, with the ownership of souls, the payment of tribute, and the stacking of icons in the corner. They belonged in an age of elaborate artifice and base superstition—when a lucky few dined on cutlets of veal and the majority endured in ignorance. </p>
<p class="calibre1">They belong with those, thought Mishka, as he turned his gaze from Helena’s portrait to the nineteenth-century novels that lined the familiar little bookcase. All those adventures and romances spun in the fanciful styles that his old friend so admired. But here, on top of the bookcase in its long narrow frame, was a genuine artifact—the black-and-white photograph of the men who signed the Treaty of Portsmouth to end the Russo-Japanese War. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mishka picked up the picture and surveyed the visages, sober and assured. Standing in formal configuration, the Japanese and Russian delegates all wore high white collars, moustaches, bow ties, and expressions suggestive of some grand sense of accomplishment—having just concluded with the stroke of a pen the war that their likes had started in the first place. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p89"></a><img class="calibre2" src="index-89_1.jpg"/></p>
<p class="calibre1">And there, just left of center, stood the Grand Duke himself: special envoy from the court of the Tsar. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It was at Idlehour in 1910 that Mishka first witnessed the Rostovs’ long-standing tradition—of gathering on the tenth anniversary of a family member’s death to raise a glass of Châteauneuf-du-Pape. Two days after the Count and he had arrived for their holiday, the guests began to appear. By four in the afternoon the drive was lined with surreys, britzkas, droshkies, and gigs from Moscow and St. Petersburg and all the neighboring districts. </p>
<p class="calibre1">And when the family gathered in the hall at five, it was the Grand Duke who was given the honor of raising the first glass in memory of the Count’s parents, who had died just hours apart. </p>
<p class="calibre1">What a formidable figure the Grand Duke had been. Seemingly born in full dress, he rarely sat, never drank, and died on the back of his horse on the twenty-first of September 1912—ten years ago to the day. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“He was a right old soul.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mishka turned to find the Count standing behind him with two Bordeaux glasses in hand. “A man of another time,” Mishka said, not without reverence, returning the picture to its shelf. Then the bottle was opened, the wine was poured, and the two old friends raised their glasses on high. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What a group we have gathered, Sasha. . . .” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Having toasted the Grand Duke and reminisced of days gone by, the old friends shifted their attention to the upcoming congress of RAPP, which turned out to be the Russian Association of Proletarian Writers. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It will be an extraordinary assembly. An extraordinary assembly at an extraordinary time. Akhmatova, Bulgakov, Mayakovksy, Mandelstam—the sort of writers who not long ago couldn’t have dined at the same table without fear of arrest—will all be there. Yes, over the years they have championed their differing styles, but in June they will gather to forge <i class="calibre3">novaya poeziya</i>, a new poetry. One that is universal, Sasha. One that doesn’t hesitate and needn’t kowtow. One that has the human spirit as its subject and the future as its muse!” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p90"></a>Just before uttering his first  <i class="calibre3">One that</i>, Mishka had leapt to his feet and now paced the Count’s little study from corner to corner, as if formulating his ideas in the privacy of his own apartment. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You remember, no doubt, that work by the Dane Thomsen. . . .” </p>
<p class="calibre1">(The Count did not remember that work by the Dane Thomsen. But he would no sooner have interrupted Mikhail on his feet than Vivaldi on his violin.)</p>

<p class="calibre1">Mishka paused to consider the ceiling. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Then came the Age of Iron—and with it the steam engine, the printing press, and the gun. Here was a very different trinity, indeed. For while these tools had been developed by the Bourgeoisie to further their own interests, it was through the engine, the press, and the pistol that the Proletariat began to free itself from labor, ignorance, and tyranny.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mishka shook his head in appreciation of either history’s trajectory or his turns of phrase. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well, my friend, I think we can agree that a new age has begun: the Age of Steel. We now have the ability to build power stations, skyscrapers, airplanes.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mishka turned to the Count. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You have seen the Shukhov Radio Tower?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The Count had not. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What a thing of beauty, Sasha. A two-hundred-foot structure of spiraling steel from which we can broadcast the latest news and intelligence</p>
<p class="calibre1">—and, yes, the sentimental strains of your Tchaikovsky—into the home of every citizen within a hundred miles. And with each one of these advances, the Russian morality has been keeping step. In our time, we may witness</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p91"></a>the end of ignorance, the end of oppression, and the advent of the brotherhood of man.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mishka stopped and waved a hand in the air. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“<i class="calibre3">But what of poetry? </i> you ask.  <i class="calibre3">What of the written word? </i> Well, I can assure you that it too is keeping pace. Once fashioned from bronze and iron, it is now being fashioned from steel. No longer an art of quatrains and dactyls and elaborate tropes, our poetry has become an art of action. One that will speed across the continents and transmit music to the stars!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Had the Count overheard such a speech spilling forth from a student in a coffeehouse, he might have observed with a glint in his eye that, apparently, it was no longer enough for a poet to write verse. Now, a poem must spring from a school with its own manifesto and stake its claim on the moment by means of the first-person plural and the future tense, with rhetorical questions and capital letters and an army of exclamation points! And above all else, it must be  <i class="calibre3">novaya</i>. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But as noted, these would have been the Count’s thoughts had he overheard someone  <i class="calibre3">else </i> speaking. Hearing the speech spill forth from Mishka filled the Count with joy. </p>
<p class="calibre1">For it is a fact that a man can be profoundly out of step with his times. A man may have been born in a city famous for its idiosyncratic culture and yet, the very habits, fashions, and ideas that exalt that city in the eyes of the world may make no sense to him at all. As he proceeds through life, he looks about in a state of confusion, understanding neither the inclinations nor the aspirations of his peers. </p>

<p class="calibre1">This had been Mishka’s lot for most of his life. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But events can unfold in such a manner that overnight the man out of step finds himself in the right place at the right time. The fashions and attitudes that had seemed so alien to him are suddenly swept aside and supplanted by fashions and attitudes in perfect sympathy with his deepest</p>

<p class="calibre1">And when this occurs—this extraordinary realignment of the stars—the man so long out of step with his times experiences a supreme lucidity. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Suddenly all that has passed comes into focus as a necessary course of events, and all that promises to unfold has the clearest rhyme and reason. </p>
<p class="calibre1">When the twice-tolling clock struck twelve, even Mishka could see the merit in having another glass of wine; and toasts were made not only to the Grand Duke, but to Helena and the Countess, to Russia and Idlehour, to poetry and pacing, and to every other worthy facet of life that they could think of. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p93"></a> <i class="calibre3"><b class="calibre4">Advent</b></i></p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre4">O</b>ne evening in late December, as he was walking the hallway to the Piazza, the Count distinctly felt a gust of frozen air, despite being fifty yards from the nearest exit to the street. It brushed past him with all the freshness and clarity of a starlit winter’s night. After pausing and searching about, he realized that the draft was coming . . . from the coatroom. Which Tanya, the attendant, had left unattended. So, with a look to his left and a look to his right, the Count stepped within. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In the preceding minutes, there must have been such a rush of parties arriving for dinner that the winter air had yet to dissipate from the fabric of their coats. Here was the greatcoat of a soldier with a dusting of snow on its shoulders; here the woolen jacket of a bureaucrat still damp; and here was a black mink coat with a collar of ermine (or was it sable?) that was in all probability worn by the mistress of a commissar. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Raising a sleeve to his face, the Count could detect smoke from a fireplace and the hint of an oriental  <i class="calibre3">eau de cologne</i>. Setting out from some elegant house on the Boulevard Ring, this young beauty presumably arrived in an automobile as black as her coat. Or perhaps she had opted to walk down Tverskaya Street, where Pushkin’s statue stood pensive but undaunted in the freshly fallen snow. Or better yet, she had come by sleigh with the hooves of the horses sounding on the cobbled streets and the crack of the whip matching the driver’s  <i class="calibre3">Hyah! </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">That was how the Count and his sister would brave the cold on Christmas Eve. Promising their grandmother that they would be no later than midnight, the siblings would set out on their troika into the crisp night air to call on their neighbors. With the Count at the reins and the pelt of a wolf on their laps, they would cut across the lower pasture to the village road, where the Count would call:  <i class="calibre3">Who shall it be first? The Bobrinskys? </i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">Or the Davidovs? </i></p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p94"></a>But whether they ventured to the one, the other, or somewhere else entirely, there would be a feast, a fire, and open arms. There would be bright dresses, and flushed skin, and sentimental uncles making misty-eyed toasts as children spied from the stairs. And music? There would be songs that emptied your glass and called you to your feet. Songs that led you to leap and alight in a manner that belied your age. Songs that made you reel and spin until you lost your bearings not only between the parlor and the salon, but between heaven and earth. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As midnight approached, the Rostov siblings would stumble from their second or third visit in search of their sleigh. Their laughter would echo under the stars and their steps would weave in wide curves back and forth across the straight tracks that they had made upon their arrival—such that in the morning their hosts would find the giant figure of a G clef transcribed by their boots in the snow. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Back in the troika they would charge across the countryside, cutting through the village of Petrovskoye, where the Church of the Ascension stood not far from its monastery’s walls. Erected in 1814 in honor of Napoleon’s defeat, the church’s campanile was rivaled only by that of the Ivan the Great tower in the Kremlin. Its twenty bells had been forged from cannons that the Interloper had been forced to abandon during his retreat, such that every peal seemed to sound:  <i class="calibre3">Long live Russia! Long live the Tsar! </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">But as they came to the bend in the road where the Count would normally give a snap of the reins to speed the horses home, Helena would place a hand on his arm to signal that he should slow the team—for midnight had just arrived, and a mile behind them the bells of Ascension had begun to swing, their chimes cascading over the frozen land in holy canticle. And in the pause between hymns, if one listened with care, above the pant of the horses, above the whistle of the wind, one could hear the bells of St. Michael’s ten miles away—and then the bells of St. Sofia’s even farther afield—calling one to another like flocks of geese across a pond at dusk. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The bells of Ascension . . . </p>
<p class="calibre1">When the Count had passed through Petrovskoye in 1918 on his hurried return from Paris, he had come upon a gathering of peasants milling in mute consternation before the monastery’s walls. The Red Cavalry, it seems, had arrived that morning with a caravan of empty wagons. At the instruction of</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p95"></a><img class="calibre2" src="index-95_1.jpg"/></p>
<p class="calibre1">their young captain, a troop of Cossacks had climbed the campanile and heaved the bells from the steeple one by one. When it came time to heave the Great Bell, a second troop of Cossacks was sent up the stairs. The old giant was hoisted from its hook, balanced on the rail, and tipped into the air, where it somersaulted once before landing in the dust with a thud. </p>
<p class="calibre1">When the abbot rushed from the monastery to confront the captain—</p>
<p class="calibre1">demanding in the name of the Lord that they cease this desecration at once</p>
<p class="calibre1">—the captain leaned against a post and lit a cigarette. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“One should render unto Caesar what is Caesar’s,” he said, “and unto God what is God’s.” With that, he instructed his men to drag the abbot up the belfry steps and hurl him from the steeple into the arms of his Maker. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Presumably, the bells of the Church of the Ascension had been reclaimed by the Bolsheviks for the manufacture of artillery, thus returning them to the realm from whence they came. Though for all the Count knew, the cannons that had been salvaged from Napoleon’s retreat to make the Ascension’s bells had been forged by the French from the bells at La Rochelle; which in turn had been forged from British blunderbusses seized in the Thirty Years’ War. From bells to cannons and back again, from now until the end of time. Such is the fate of iron ore. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Count Rostov . . . ?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The Count looked up from his reverie to find Tanya standing in the doorway. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Sable I should think,” said the Count, dropping the sleeve. “Yes, most definitely sable.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">December in the Piazza . . . </p>
<p class="calibre1">From the day the Metropol opened its doors, the good people of Moscow had looked to the Piazza to set the tone of the season. For by five o’clock on the first of December, the room had already been festooned in anticipation of the New Year. Evergreen garlands with bright red berries hung from the fountain. Strings of lights fell from the balconies. And revelers? From all across Moscow they came, such that by eight o’clock, when the orchestra struck up its first festive song, every table was spoken for. By nine, the waiters were dragging chairs in from the corridors so that</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p96"></a>latecomers could hang their arms over the shoulders of friends. And at the center of every table—whether it was hosted by the high or the humble—</p>
<p class="calibre1">was a serving of caviar, for it is the genius of this particular delicacy that it may be enjoyed by the ounce or the pound. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As such, it was with a touch of disappointment that the Count entered the Piazza on this winter solstice to find the room ungarlanded, the balustrades unstrung, an accordion player on the bandstand, and two-thirds of the tables empty. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But then, as every child knows, the drumbeat of the season must sound from within. And there, at her usual table by the fountain, was Nina with a dark green ribbon tied around the waist of her bright yellow dress. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Merry Christmas,” said the Count with a bow when he reached the table. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nina stood and curtsied. “The joys of the season to you, sir.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">When they were seated with their napkins in their laps, Nina explained that as she would be meeting her father for dinner a little later, she had taken the liberty of ordering herself an hors d’oeuvre. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Quite sensible,” said the Count. </p>
<p class="calibre1">At that moment, the Bishop appeared, carrying a small tower of ice creams. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The hors d’oeuvre?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“<i class="calibre3">Oui</i>,” Nina replied. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Having placed the dish before Nina with a priestly smile, the Bishop turned and asked if the Count would like a menu (as if he didn’t know it by heart!). </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No thank you, my good man. Just a glass of champagne and a spoon.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Systematic in all matters of importance, Nina ate her ice cream one flavor at a time, moving from the lightest to the darkest in shade. Thus, having already dispatched her French vanilla, she was now moving on to a scoop of lemon, which perfectly matched her dress. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“So,” said the Count, “are you looking forward to your visit home?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes, it will be nice to see everyone,” said Nina. “But when we return to Moscow in January, I shall be starting school.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You don’t seem very excited by the prospect.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I fear it will be dreadfully dull,” she admitted, “and positively overrun with children.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p97"></a>The Count nodded gravely to acknowledge the indisputable likelihood of children in the schoolhouse; then, as he dipped his own spoon into the scoop of strawberry, he noted that he had enjoyed school very much. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Everybody tells me that.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I loved reading the <i class="calibre3"> Odyssey </i> and the  <i class="calibre3">Aeneid</i>; and I made some of the finest friends of my life. . . .” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes, yes,” she said with a roll of her eyes. “Everybody tells me that too.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well, sometimes everybody tells you something because it is true.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Sometimes,” Nina clarified, “everybody tells you something because they are everybody. But why should one listen to everybody? Did <i class="calibre3">everybody</i> write the <i class="calibre3"> Odyssey? </i> Did  <i class="calibre3">everybody</i> write the  <i class="calibre3">Aeneid</i>?” She shook her head then concluded definitively: “The only difference between everybody and nobody is all the shoes.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Perhaps the Count should have left it at that. But he hated the idea of his young friend beginning her Moscow school days with such a desolatory view. As she progressed through the dark purple scoop (presumably blackberry), he considered how best to articulate the virtues of a formal education. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“While there are certainly some irksome aspects to school,” he conceded after a moment, “I think you will find to your eventual delight that the experience has broadened your horizons.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nina looked up. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What do you mean by that?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What do I mean by what?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“By  <i class="calibre3">broadened your horizons</i>.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The Count’s assertion had seemed so axiomatic that he had not prepared an elaboration. So before responding, he signaled the Bishop for another glass of champagne. For centuries champagne has been used to launch marriages and ships. Most assume this is because the drink is so intrinsically celebratory; but, in fact, it is used at the onset of these dangerous enterprises because it so capably boosts one’s resolve. When the glass was placed on the table, the Count took a swig large enough to tickle his sinuses. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“By broadening your horizons,” he ventured, “what I meant is that education will give you a sense of the world’s scope, of its wonders, of its</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p98"></a>many and varied ways of life.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Wouldn’t travel achieve that more effectively?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Travel?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We are talking about horizons, aren’t we? That horizontal line at the limit of sight? Rather than sitting in orderly rows in a schoolhouse, wouldn’t one be better served by working her way toward an  <i class="calibre3">actual</i> horizon, so that she could see what lay beyond it? That’s what Marco Polo did when he traveled to China. And what Columbus did when he traveled to America. And what Peter the Great did when he traveled through Europe <i class="calibre3">incognito</i>!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nina paused to take a great mouthful of the chocolate, and when the Count appeared about to reply she waved her spoon to indicate that she was not yet finished. He waited attentively for her to swallow. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Last night my father took me to  <i class="calibre3">Scheherazade</i>.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Ah,” the Count replied (grateful for the change of subject). “Rimsky-Korsakov at his best.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Perhaps. I wouldn’t know. The point is: According to the program, the composition was intended to ‘enchant’ the listeners with ‘the world of the Arabian Nights.’” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That realm of Aladdin and the lamp,” said the Count with a smile. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Exactly. And, in fact, everyone in the theater seemed utterly enchanted.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well, there you are.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“And yet, not one of them has any intention of  <i class="calibre3">going</i> to Arabia—even though that is where the lamp is.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">By some extraordinary conspiracy of fate, at the very instant Nina made this pronouncement, the accordion player concluded an old favorite and the sparsely populated room broke into applause. Sitting back, Nina gestured to her fellow customers with both hands as if their ovation were the final proof of her position. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It is the mark of a fine chess player to tip over his own king when he sees that defeat is inevitable, no matter how many moves remain in the game. Thus, the Count inquired:</p>
<p class="calibre1">“How was your hors d’oeuvre?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Splendid.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p99"></a>The accordion player now began to play a jaunty little melody reminiscent of an English carol. Taking this as his signal, the Count indicated that he would like to make a toast. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It is a sad but unavoidable fact of life,” he began, “that as we age our social circles grow smaller. Whether from increased habit or diminished vigor, we suddenly find ourselves in the company of just a few familiar faces. So I view it as an incredible stroke of good fortune at this stage in my life to have found such a fine new friend.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">With that, the Count reached into his pocket and presented Nina with a gift. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Here is a little something that I made great use of when I was your age. </p>
<p class="calibre1">May it tide you over until you travel  <i class="calibre3">incognito</i>.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nina smiled in a manner that suggested (rather unconvincingly) that he absolutely shouldn’t have. Then she unwrapped the paper to reveal the Countess Rostov’s hexagonal opera glasses. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“They were my grandmother’s,” said the Count. </p>
<p class="calibre1">For the first time in their acquaintance, Nina was struck dumb. She turned the little binoculars in her hands, admiring the mother-of-pearl scopes and delicate brass fittings. Then she held them to her eyes so she could slowly scan the room. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You know me better than anyone,” she said after a moment. “I shall treasure them to my dying day.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">That she had not thought to bring a present for the Count struck him as perfectly understandable. After all, she was only a child; and the days of unwrapping surprises were decidedly behind him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It’s getting late,” said the Count. “I wouldn’t want you to keep your father waiting.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes,” she admitted regretfully. “It is time for me to go.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Then looking back toward the captain’s station, she raised a hand as one who signals for the check. But when the captain approached the table, he did not have the check. Instead, he had a large yellow box tied with dark green ribbon. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Here,” Nina said, “is a little something for you. But you must promise that you will not open it until the stroke of midnight.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p100"></a><img class="calibre2" src="index-100_1.jpg"/></p>

<p class="calibre1">In some lecture hall, this lad with a hint of a moustache had presumably admired his fellow student for the sharpness of her intellect and the seriousness of her mien. Eventually, he had worked up the nerve to invite her out, perhaps under the pretense of discussing some matter of ideological interest. And now here she was, sitting before him in the Piazza looking about the room without a smile on her face or a word on her lips. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Attempting to break the silence, the lad remarked on the upcoming conference to unify the Soviet republics—a reasonable gambit given her apparent intensity. Sure enough, the young lady had views on the subject; but as she voiced her opinion on the Transcaucas question, the tenor of the conversation turned decidedly technical. What’s more, the young man, having adopted an expression as serious as hers, was clearly out of his depth. Were he to venture his own opinion now, he would almost certainly be revealed as a poseur, as one who was inadequately informed on the crucial issues of the day. From there, the evening could only get worse, and he would end up dragging his hopes behind him in the manner of the chastened child who drags his stuffed bear thumping up the stairs. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But just as the young lady was inviting him to share his thoughts on the matter, the accordion player began a little number with a Spanish flair. It must have struck a chord, because she interrupted herself in order to look at the musician and wonder aloud where that melody was from. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It is from the  <i class="calibre3">The Nutcracker</i>,” the young man responded without a thought. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“<i class="calibre3">The Nutcracker . . . , </i>” she repeated. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Given the prevailing sobriety of her expression, it was unclear what she thought of this music from another era. As such, many a veteran would have counseled the young man to proceed with caution—to wait and hear</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p101"></a>what associations the music held for her. Instead, he acted; and he acted boldly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“When I was a boy, my grandmother took me every year.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The young lady turned back from the musician to face her companion. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I suppose some think the music sentimental,” he continued, “but I never fail to attend the ballet when it is performed in December, even if it means attending alone.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">Well done, lad. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">The expression on the girl’s face softened noticeably and her eyes displayed a hint of interest, that here was an unexpected aspect of her new acquaintance, something pure and heartfelt and unapologetic. Her lips parted as she prepared to ask a question—</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Are you ready to order?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">It was the Bishop leaning over their table. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">Of course they are not ready to order, </i> the Count wished to shout.  <i class="calibre3">As any</i> <i class="calibre3">fool can see! </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">If the young man were wise, he would send the Bishop packing and ask the young lady to go on with her question. Instead, he dutifully picked up the menu. Perhaps he imagined that the perfect dish would leap off the page and identify itself by name. But for a hopeful young man trying to impress a serious young woman, the menu of the Piazza was as perilous as the Straits of Messina. On the left was a Scylla of lower-priced dishes that could suggest a penny-pinching lack of flair; and on the right was a Charybdis of delicacies that could empty one’s pockets while painting one pretentious. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The young man’s gaze drifted back and forth between these opposing hazards. But in a stroke of genius, he ordered the Latvian stew. </p>
<p class="calibre1">While this traditional dish of pork, onions, and apricots was reasonably priced, it was also reasonably exotic; and it somehow harkened back to that world of grandmothers and holidays and sentimental melodies that they had been about to discuss when so rudely interrupted. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’ll have the same,” said our serious young lady. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">The same! </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">And then she glanced at her hopeful young acquaintance with a touch of that tenderness that Natasha had shown Pierre in  <i class="calibre3">War and Peace</i> at the end of Volume Two. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p102"></a>“And would you like some wine to go with your stew?” asked the Bishop. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The young man hesitated and then picked up the wine list with uncertain hands. It may well have been the first time in his life that he had ordered a bottle of wine. Never mind that he didn’t grasp the merits of the 1900</p>
<p class="calibre1">versus the 1901, he didn’t know a Burgundy from a Bordeaux. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Giving the young man no more than a minute to consider his options, the Bishop leaned forward and poked the list with a condescending smile. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Perhaps the Rioja.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The Rioja? Now there was a wine that would clash with the stew as Achilles clashed with Hector. It would slay the dish with a blow to the head and drag it behind its chariot until it tested the fortitude of every man in Troy. Besides, it plainly cost three times what the young man could afford. </p>
<p class="calibre1">With a shake of the head, the Count reflected that there was simply no substitute for experience. Here had been an ideal opportunity for a waiter to fulfill his purpose. By recommending a suitable wine, he could have put a young man at ease, perfected a meal, and furthered the cause of romance, all in a stroke. But whether from a lack of subtlety or a lack of sense, the Bishop had not only failed in his purpose, he had put his customer in a corner. And the young man, clearly unsure of what to do and beginning to feel as if the whole restaurant were watching, was on the verge of accepting the Bishop’s suggestion. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“If I may,” the Count interjected. “For a serving of Latvian stew, you will find no better choice than a bottle of the Mukuzani.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Leaning toward their table and mimicking the perfectly parted fingers of Andrey, the Count gestured to the entry on the list. That this wine was a fraction of the cost of the Rioja need not be a matter of a discussion between gentlemen. Instead, the Count simply noted: “The Georgians practically grow their grapes in the hopes that one day they will accompany such a stew.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The young man exchanged a brief glance with his companion as if to say,  <i class="calibre3">Who is this eccentric? </i> But then he turned to the Bishop. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“A bottle of the Mukuzani.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Of course,” replied the Bishop. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Minutes later, the wine had been presented and poured, and the young woman was asking her companion what his grandmother was like. While</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p103"></a><img class="calibre2" src="index-103_1.jpg"/></p>
<p class="calibre1">for his part, the Count cast off any thoughts of herb-encrusted lamb at the Boyarsky. Instead, he summoned Petya to take Nina’s present to his room and ordered the Latvian stew and a bottle of the Mukuzani for himself. </p>
<p class="calibre1">And just as he’d suspected, it was the perfect dish for the season. The onions thoroughly caramelized, the pork slowly braised, and the apricots briefly stewed, the three ingredients came together in a sweet and smoky medley that simultaneously suggested the comfort of a snowed-in tavern and the jangle of a Gypsy tambourine. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As the Count took a sip of his wine, the young couple caught his eye and raised their own glasses in a toast of gratitude and kinship. Then they returned to their conversation, which had grown so intimate, it could no longer be heard over the sound of the accordion. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Young love, thought the Count with a smile. There is nothing  <i class="calibre3">novaya</i> about it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Will there be anything else?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">It was the Bishop addressing the Count. He considered for a moment, then he asked for a single scoop of vanilla ice cream. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As the Count entered the lobby, he noticed four men in evening dress coming through the door with black leather cases in hand, clearly one of the string quartets that occasionally played in the private dining rooms upstairs. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Three of the musicians looked as if they had been performing together since the nineteenth century, sharing the same white hair and weary professionalism. But the second violinist stood out from the others as he couldn’t have been more than twenty-two and retained a certain brightness to his step. It was only as the quartet approached the elevator that the Count recognized him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The Count probably hadn’t seen Nikolai Petrov since 1914 when the Prince had been no more than a lad of thirteen; and given the passage of time, the Count might not have recognized him at all were it not for his unassuming smile—a distinguishing feature of the Petrov line for generations. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Nikolai?” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p104"></a>When the Count spoke, the four musicians turned from the elevator and eyed him with curiosity. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Alexander Ilyich . . . ?” the Prince asked after a moment. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“None other.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The Prince encouraged his colleagues to go ahead and then offered the Count the familial smile. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It’s good to see you, Alexander.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“And you.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">They were quiet for a moment, then the Prince’s expression changed from one of surprise to curiosity. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Is that . . . ice cream?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What? Oh! Yes, it is. Though not for me.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The Prince nodded in bemusement, but without further remark. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Tell me,” the Count ventured, “have you heard from Dmitry?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I believe he is in Switzerland.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Ah,” said the Count with a smile. “The purest air in Europe.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The Prince shrugged, as if to say he had heard something of the sort, but wouldn’t know firsthand. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The last time I saw you,” observed the Count, “you were playing Bach at one of your grandmother’s dinner parties.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The Prince laughed and held up his case. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I guess I am still playing Bach at dinner parties.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Then he gestured toward the departed elevator and said with unmistakable fondness:</p>
<p class="calibre1">“That was Sergei Eisenov.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">At the turn of the century, Sergei Eisenov had given music lessons to half the boys on the Boulevard Ring. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It’s not easy for our likes to find work,” said the Prince. “But Sergei hires me when he can.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The Count had so many questions: Were there other members of the Petrov family still in Moscow? Was his grandmother alive? Was he still living in that wonderful house on Pushkin Square? But the two were standing in the middle of a hotel lobby as men and women headed up the stairs—including some in formal clothes. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“They’ll be wondering what’s become of me,” said the Prince. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p105"></a><img class="calibre2" src="index-105_1.jpg"/></p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes, of course. I didn’t mean to keep you.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The Prince nodded and turned to mount the stairs, but then turned back. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We are playing here again on Saturday night,” he said. “Perhaps we could meet afterwards for a drink.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That would be splendid,” said the <a href="index_split_006.html#p455">Count.*</a></p>
<p class="calibre1">When the Count arrived on the sixth floor, he clicked his tongue three times then went into his bedroom, leaving the door ajar. On the desk sat Nina’s gift where Petya had left it. Taking it under an arm, the Count passed through his jackets into his study, set the present on his grandmother’s table, and put the bowl of melted ice cream on the floor. As the Count poured himself a glass of port, a silvery shadow swerved around his feet and approached the bowl. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Happy holidays to you, Herr Drosselmeyer.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Meow,” replied the cat. </p>
<p class="calibre1">According to the twice-tolling clock, it was only eleven. So with his port in one hand and  <i class="calibre3">A Christmas Carol</i> in the other, the Count tilted back his chair and dutifully waited for the chime of twelve. Admittedly, it takes a certain amount of discipline to sit in a chair and read a novel, even a seasonal one, when a beautifully wrapped present waits within arm’s reach and the only witness is a one-eyed cat. But this was a discipline the Count had mastered as a child when, in the days leading up to Christmas, he had marched past the closed drawing-room doors with the unflinching stare of a Buckingham Palace guard. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The young Count’s self-mastery did not stem from a precocious admiration of military regimentation, nor a priggish adherence to household rules. By the time he was ten, it was perfectly clear that the Count was neither priggish nor regimental (as a phalanx of educators, caretakers, and constables could attest). No, if the Count mastered the discipline of marching past the closed drawing-room doors, it was because experience had taught him that this was the best means of ensuring the splendor of the season. </p>
<p class="calibre1">For on Christmas Eve, when his father finally gave the signal and he and Helena were allowed to pull the doors apart—there was the twelve-foot</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p106"></a><img class="calibre2" src="index-106_1.jpg"/></p>
<p class="calibre1">spruce lit up from trunk to tip and garlands hanging from every shelf. There were the bowls of oranges from Seville and the brightly colored candies from Vienna. And hidden somewhere under the tree was that unexpected gift—be it a wooden sword with which to defend the ramparts, or a lantern with which to explore a mummy’s tomb. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Such is the magic of Christmas in childhood, thought the Count a little wistfully, that a single gift can provide one with endless hours of adventure while not even requiring one to leave one’s house <i class="calibre3">. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">Drosselmeyer, who had retired to the other high-back chair to lick his paws, suddenly turned his one-eyed gaze toward the closet door with his little ears upright. What he must have heard was the whirring of inner wheels, for a second later came the first of midnight’s chimes. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Setting his book and his port aside, the Count placed Nina’s gift in his lap with his fingers on the dark green bow and listened to the tolling of the clock. Only with the twelfth and final chime did he pull the ribbon’s ends. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What do you think,  <i class="calibre3">mein Herr</i>? A dapper hat?” </p>


<p class="calibre1">When the Count climbed into bed with his Dickens at 12:15, he assumed he would only read a paragraph or two before switching off the light; but instead, he found himself reading with the greatest interest. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He had reached the part in the story where Scrooge is being spirited around by that jolly giant, the Ghost of Christmas Present. Over the course of his childhood, the Count had been read  <i class="calibre3">A Christmas Carol</i> no less than three times. So, he certainly remembered the visit Scrooge and his guide paid to the laughter-filled party at Scrooge’s nephew’s house; just as he</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p107"></a>remembered the visit they paid to the humble, yet heartfelt celebration at the Cratchits’. But he had completely forgotten that upon leaving the Cratchits’, the Second Spirit had taken Scrooge out of the city of London altogether, to a bleak and deserted moor where a family of miners was celebrating the season in their ramshackle hut at the edge of the mine; and from there to a lighthouse on a rocky outpost where the waves thundered as the two craggy keepers of the beacon joined their hands in yuletide song; and from there, further and further the Spirit carried Scrooge, into the howling darkness of the rolling sea, until they alit upon the deck of a ship where every man good or bad had fond thoughts of home and a kinder word for his mates. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Who knows. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Perhaps what stirred the Count were these far-flung figures sharing in the fellowship of the season despite their lives of hard labor in inhospitable climes. Perhaps it was the sight earlier in the evening of that modern young couple proceeding toward romance in the age-old fashion. Perhaps it was the chance meeting with Nikolai, who, despite his heritage, seemed to be finding a place for himself in the new Russia. Or perhaps it was the utterly unanticipated blessing of Nina’s friendship. Whatever the cause, when the Count closed his book and turned out the light, he fell asleep with a great sense of well-being. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But had the Ghost of Christmas Yet to Come suddenly appeared and roused the Count to give him a glimpse of the future, he would have seen that his sense of well-being had been premature. For less than four years later, after another careful accounting of the twice-tolling clock’s twelve chimes, Alexander Ilyich Rostov would be climbing to the roof of the Metropol Hotel in his finest jacket and gamely approaching its parapet in order to throw himself into the street below. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p108"></a><img class="calibre2" src="index-108_1.jpg"/></p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre4">BOOK TWO</b></p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p109"></a><b class="calibre4">1923</b></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3"><b class="calibre4">An Actress, an Apparition, an Apiary</b></i></p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre4">A</b>t five o’clock on the twenty-first of June, the Count stood before his closet with his hand on his plain gray blazer and hesitated. In a few minutes, he would be on his way to the barbershop for his weekly visit, and then to the Shalyapin to meet Mishka, who would probably be wearing the same brown jacket he’d worn since 1913. As such, the gray blazer seemed a perfectly suitable choice of attire. That is, until one considered that it was an anniversary of sorts—for it had been one year to the day since the Count had last set foot outside of the Metropol Hotel. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But how was one to celebrate such an anniversary? And should one? For while house arrest is a definitive infringement upon one’s liberty, presumably it is also intended to be something of a humiliation. So both pride and common sense would suggest that such an anniversary might best be left unmarked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">And yet . . . </p>
<p class="calibre1">Even men in the most trying of circumstances—like those lost at sea or confined to prison—will find the means to carefully account the passing of a year. Despite the fact that all the splendid modulations of the seasons and those colorful festivities that recur in the course of normal life have been replaced by a tyranny of indistinguishable days, the men in such situations will carve their 365 notches into a piece of wood or scratch them into the walls of their cell. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Why do they go to such lengths to mark time? When, ostensibly, to do so should matter to them least of all? Well, for one, it provides an occasion to reflect on the inevitable progress of the world they’ve left behind:  <i class="calibre3">Ah,</i> <i class="calibre3">Alyosha must now be able to climb the tree in the yard; and Vanya must be</i></p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p110"></a><img class="calibre2" src="index-110_1.jpg"/></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">entering the academy; and Nadya, dear Nadya, will soon be of an age to</i> <i class="calibre3">marry. . . . </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">But just as important, a careful accounting of days allows the isolated to note that another year of hardship has been endured; survived; bested. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Whether they have found the strength to persevere through a tireless determination or some foolhardy optimism, those 365 hatch marks stand as proof of their indomitability. For after all, if attentiveness should be measured in minutes and discipline measured in hours, then indomitability must be measured in years. Or, if philosophical investigations are not to your taste, then let us simply agree that the wise man celebrates what he can. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Thus, the Count donned his finest smoking jacket (custom-made in Paris from a burgundy velvet) and headed down the stairs. </p>
<p class="calibre1">When the Count reached the lobby, before he could continue to the barbershop his eyes were drawn to a willowy figure coming through the hotel’s doors. But then all eyes in the lobby were drawn to her. A tall woman in her midtwenties with arched eyebrows and auburn hair, she was indisputably striking. And as she approached the front desk, she walked with a breezy sureness as seemingly unaware of the feathers projecting from her hat as of the bellhops dragging her luggage behind her. But what guaranteed her position as the natural center of attention were the two borzois she had on leash. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In an instant the Count could see that they were magnificent beasts. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Their coats silver, their loins lean, their every sense alert, these dogs had been raised to give chase in the cold October air with a hunting party hot on their heels. And at day’s end? They were meant to sit at the feet of their master before a fire in a manor house—not adorn the hands of a willow in the lobby of a grand hotel. . . . </p>
<p class="calibre1">The injustice of this was not lost on the dogs. As their mistress addressed Arkady at the front desk, they tugged every which way, sniffing about for familiar landmarks. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Stop it!” the willow commanded in a surprisingly husky voice. Then she yanked in a manner that showed she had no more familiarity with the</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p111"></a>wolfhounds on her leashes than she had with the birds that had feathered her hat. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The Count gave the situation the shake of the head it deserved. But as he turned to go, he noticed with some amusement that a slender shadow suddenly jumped from behind a wingback chair to the edge of one of the potted palms. It was none other than Field Marshal Kutuzov attaining higher ground to take measure of his foes <i class="calibre3">. </i> When the dogs turned their heads in unison with their ears upright, the one-eyed cat slipped behind the trunk of the tree. Then having satisfied himself that the dogs were securely tethered, the cat alit from the palm to the floor and without even bothering to arch his back opened his little jaws and hissed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">With a terrific volley of barking, the dogs leapt to the extent of their leashes, tugging their mistress from the front desk as the ledger pen clattered to the floor. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Whoa,” she shouted. “Whoa!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Apparently unfamiliar with equine commands, the wolfhounds leapt again and, freeing themselves from the willow’s grip, scrambled toward their prey. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Kutuzov was off like a shot. Slipping under the western embankment of lobby chairs, the one-eyed cat dashed toward the front door, as if intending to escape into the street. Without a moment’s hesitation, the dogs gave chase. Opting for a pincer movement, they split at the potted palms and pursued the cat on opposite sides of the chairs in the hopes of cutting him off at the door. A lamp that blocked the path of the first hound was knocked to the floor in a shower of sparks, while a standing ashtray that blocked the second was sent head over heels, discharging a cloud of dust. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But just as the dogs were closing ranks, Kutuzov—who like his namesake had the advantage of familiar terrain—suddenly reversed course. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Cutting in front of a coffee table, he dashed under the eastern embankment of lobby chairs and headed back toward the staircase. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It took only a few seconds for the borzois to recognize the cat’s tactic; but if attentiveness is measured in minutes, discipline in hours, and indomitability in years, then the attaining of the upper hand on the field of battle is measured in the instant. For just as the wolfhounds registered the cat’s reversal and attempted to turn, the lobby’s expansive oriental carpet</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p112"></a>came to an end, and the dogs’ momentum sent them skidding across the marble floor into the luggage of an arriving guest. </p>
<p class="calibre1">With an advantage over his adversaries of a hundred feet, Kutuzov skipped up the first few steps of the staircase, paused for a moment to admire his handiwork, then disappeared around the corner. </p>
<p class="calibre1">You may accuse a dog of eating without grace or of exhibiting a misplaced enthusiasm for the tossing of sticks, but you may never accuse one of giving up hope. Despite the fact that the cat had a decisive lead and knew every nook and cranny of the hotel’s upper floors, once the dogs regained their footing, they charged across the lobby in full chorus with every intention of mounting the stairs. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But the Hotel Metropol was not a hunting ground. It was a residence par excellence, an oasis for the worn and weary. So, with a slight curl of the tongue, the Count gave an upward sloping whistle in G major. At the sound, the dogs broke pursuit and began restlessly circling at the foot of the stairs. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The Count gave two more whistles in quick succession and the dogs, resigning themselves to the fact that the day was lost, trotted to the Count and heeled at his feet. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well, my boys,” he said, giving them a good scratching behind the ears, </p>
<p class="calibre1">“where do you hail from?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Arf,” replied the dogs. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Ah,” said the Count. “How lovely.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">After smoothing her skirt and straightening her hat, the willowy one gracefully crossed the lobby to the Count, where, thanks to a pair of French heels, she met him eye to eye. At such proximity the Count could see that she was even more beautiful than he had suspected; and haughtier too. His natural sympathies remained with the dogs. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Thank you,” she said (with a smile that presumed to launch armadas). </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’m afraid that they are quite ill bred.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“On the contrary,” replied the Count, “they appear to be perfectly bred.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The willow made a second effort at her smile. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What I meant to say is that they are ill behaved.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes, perhaps ill behaved; but that is a matter of handling, not breeding.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">As the willow studied the Count, he noted that the arches over her eyebrows were very much like the marcato notation in music—that accent</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p113"></a><img class="calibre2" src="index-113_1.jpg"/></p>
<p class="calibre1">which instructs one to play a phrase a little more loudly. This, no doubt, accounted for the willow’s preference for issuing commands and the resulting huskiness of her voice. But as the Count was coming to this conclusion, the willow was apparently coming to a conclusion of her own, for she now dispensed with any intent to charm. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Handling does seem to have a way of eclipsing breeding,” she said acerbically. “And for that very reason, I should think that even some of the best-bred dogs belong on the shortest leashes.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“An understandable conclusion,” replied the Count. “But I should think the best-bred dogs belong in the surest hands.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">One hour later, with his hair neatly trimmed and his chin cleanly shaved, the Count entered the Shalyapin and selected a small table in the corner at which to wait for Mishka, who was in town for the inaugural congress of RAPP. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It was only as he settled in that he realized the willowy beauty, now in a long blue dress, was sitting on the banquette directly opposite his own. She had spared the bar the spectacle of trying to manage her dogs, but in their place she had brought along a round-faced fellow with a receding hairline for whom puppylike devotion seemed to come a little more naturally. While the Count was smiling at his own observation, he happened to meet the willow’s gaze. As was only fitting, the two adults immediately acted as if they hadn’t seen each other, the one by turning to her puppy and the other by turning to the door. And as luck would have it, there was Mishka right on time—but with a brand-new jacket and a well-groomed beard. . . . </p>
<p class="calibre1">The Count came out from behind the table in order to embrace his friend. Then, rather than reclaim his seat, he offered the banquette to Mishka—an action that seemed at once courteous and opportune, since it allowed the Count to turn his back on the willow. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well now,” said the Count with a clap of the hands. “What shall it be, my friend? Champagne? Château d’Yquem? A dish of beluga before supper?” But with a shake of the head, Mishka asked for a beer and explained that he could not stay for dinner, after all. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p114"></a>Naturally, the Count was disappointed by the news. After a discreet inquiry, he had learned that the evening’s special at the Boyarsky was roasted duck—the perfect dish for two old friends to share. And Andrey had promised to set aside a particular Grand Cru that not only complemented the duck, but would inevitably lead to a retelling of the infamous night when the Count had become locked in the Rothschilds’ wine cellar with the young Baroness. . . . </p>
<p class="calibre1">But while the Count was disappointed, he could see from his old friend’s fidgeting that he had his own stories to tell. So, as soon as their beers were before them, the Count asked how things were progressing at the congress. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Taking a drink, Mishka nodded that here was the topic of the hour—the very conversation that would soon be engrossing all of Russia, if not the world. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“There were no hushed voices today, Sasha. No dozing or fiddling with pencils. For in every corner from every hand there was work being done.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">If offering Mishka the banquette had been gracious and opportune, it also had the added benefit of keeping him in his seat. For were he not trapped behind the table, he would already have leapt to his feet and been pacing the bar. And what was the work being done at this congress? As best as the Count could determine, it included the drafting of “Declarations of Intent,” “Proclamations of Allegiance,” and “Open Statements of Solidarity.” Indeed, the Russian Association of Proletarian Writers didn’t hesitate to express their solidarity. In fact, they expressed it not only with their fellow writers, publishers, and editors, but with the masons and stevedores, the welders and riveters, even the street sweepers. <a href="index_split_006.html#p457">*</a></p>
<p class="calibre1">So fevered was the first day of the congress that dinner wasn’t served until eleven o’clock. And then at a table set for sixty, they heard from Mayakovsky himself. There were no lecterns, mind you. When the plates had been served, he simply banged on the table and stood on his chair. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In the interests of realism, Mishka tried to stand on the banquette, nearly knocking over his beer. He settled for a seated oration with a finger in the air:</p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">Suddenly—I</i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">shone in all my might, </i></p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p115"></a> <i class="calibre3">and morning rang its round. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">Always to shine, </i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">to shine everywhere, </i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">to the very depths of the last days, </i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">to shine—</i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">and to hell with everything else! </i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">That is my motto—</i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">and the sun’s! </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">Naturally, Mayakovsky’s poem prompted unrestrained applause and the smashing of glasses. But then, just as everyone had settled down and was preparing to slice into their chicken, some fellow named Zelinsky was up on his chair. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“For, of course, we  <i class="calibre3">must</i> hear from Zelinsky,” muttered Mishka. “As if <i class="calibre3">he</i> stands shoulder to shoulder with Mayakovsky. As if he stands shoulder to shoulder with a bottle of milk.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mishka took another sip. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You remember Zelinsky. No? The one who was a few years behind us at the university? The one who wore a monocle in ’16 and a sailor’s cap the following year? Well, anyway, you know the sort, Sasha—the type who must always have their hands on the wheel. At the end of dinner, say two of you are lingering in your chairs to continue a discussion from earlier in the day—well, there is Zelinsky proclaiming that he knows just the place to carry on the conversation. Next thing you know, there are ten of you being crowded around a table in some basement café. When you go to take a seat, he has a hand on your shoulder, steering you to this end of the table or that. </p>
<p class="calibre1">And when someone calls for bread, he has a better idea. They have the best zavitushki in Moscow, he says. And before you know it, he’s snapping his fingers in the air.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Here Mishka snapped his fingers three times so emphatically that the Count had to wave off the ever-attentive Audrius, who was already halfway across the room. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“And his ideas!” Mishka continued in disdain. “On and on he goes with his declarations, as if he is in a position to enlighten anyone on matters of verse. And what does he have to say to the impressionable young student at</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p116"></a>his side? That all poets must eventually bow before the haiku.  <i class="calibre3">Bow before</i> <i class="calibre3">the haiku! </i> Can you imagine.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“For my part,” contributed the Count, “I am glad that Homer wasn’t born in Japan.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mishka stared at the Count for a moment then burst out laughing. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes,” he said, slapping the table and wiping a tear from his eye. “Glad that Homer wasn’t born in Japan. I shall have to remember to tell that one to Katerina.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mishka smiled in apparent anticipation of telling that one to Katerina. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Katerina . . . ?” asked the Count. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mishka casually reached for his beer. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Katerina Litvinova. Have I not mentioned her before? She’s a talented young poet from Kiev—in her second year at the university. We sit on a committee together.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mishka leaned back in order to drink from his glass. The Count leaned back in order to smile at his companion—as the entire picture came into focus. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A new jacket and a well-groomed beard . . . </p>
<p class="calibre1">A discussion after dinner continued from earlier in the day . . . </p>
<p class="calibre1">And a Zelinsky who, having dragged everyone to his favorite little nightspot, steers an impressionable young poet to one end of the table and a Mishka to the other. . . . </p>
<p class="calibre1">As Mishka continued with his description of the previous evening, the irony of the situation did not escape the Count: that during all those years they had lived above the cobbler’s, it was Mishka who had stayed put and the Count who, having apologized that he couldn’t join his friend for dinner, had returned hours later with tales of lively toasts and  <i class="calibre3">tête-à-têtes</i> and impromptu outings to candlelit cafés. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Did the Count take some pleasure in hearing about Mishka’s late-night skirmishes? Of course he did. Particularly when he learned that at the end of the evening, as the group was about to climb into three different cabs, Mishka reminded Zelinsky that he had forgotten his hat; and when Zelinsky dashed back inside to retrieve it, Katerina from Kiev leaned from her cab to call:  <i class="calibre3">Here, Mikhail Fyodorovich, why don’t you ride with us. . . . </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">Yes, the Count took pleasure in his old friend’s romantic skirmish; but that is not to suggest that he didn’t feel the sting of envy. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p117"></a><img class="calibre2" src="index-117_1.jpg"/></p>
<p class="calibre1"><img class="calibre2" src="index-117_2.jpg"/></p>
<p class="calibre1">Half an hour later, after the Count had sent Mishka off to a discussion on the future of meter (at which Katerina from Kiev would presumably be in attendance), he headed to the Boyarsky, apparently destined to dine on duck alone. But just as he was leaving, Audrius beckoned. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Sliding a folded piece of paper across the bar, Audrius explained under his breath: “I was instructed to relay this to you.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“To me? From whom?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Miss Urbanova.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Miss Urbanova?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Anna Urbanova. The movie star.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Since the Count still showed no sign of understanding, the bartender explained a little more loudly: “The one who was sitting at that table across from you.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Ah, yes. Thank you.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">As Audrius returned to his work, the Count unfolded the piece of paper, which bore the following request in a willowy script:</p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">Please allow me a second chance</i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">at a first impression</i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">in suite 208</i></p>
<p class="calibre1">When the Count knocked on the door of suite 208, it was opened by an older woman who regarded him with impatience. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I am Alexander Rostov. . . .” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You’re expected. Come in. Miss Urbanova will be a moment.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Instinctively, the Count prepared to offer the woman a witty remark about the weather, but when he stepped inside she stepped out and closed the door, leaving him alone in the entryway. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Decorated in the style of a Venetian palazzo, suite 208 was one of the finest accommodations on the floor and looked no worse for wear now that the tireless typers of directives had finally moved to the Kremlin. With a bedroom and drawing room on either side of a grand salon, its ceilings were</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p118"></a>painted with allegorical figures gazing down from the heavens. On an ornate side table stood two towering arrangements of flowers—one of calla lilies and the other of long-stemmed roses. The fact that the two arrangements matched each other in extravagance while clashing in color suggested they were from competing admirers. One could only imagine what a third admirer would feel obliged to send. . . . </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’ll be right out,” called a voice from the bedroom. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Take your time,” called back the Count. </p>
<p class="calibre1">At the sound of his voice, there was a light clacking of nails on the floor as the borzois appeared from the drawing room. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Hello, boys,” he said, giving them another scratch behind the ears. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Having paid their respects, the dogs trotted to the windows overlooking Theatre Square and rested their forepaws on the sills in order to watch the movement of the cars below. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Count Rostov!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Turning, the Count found the actress dressed in her third outfit of the day: black pants and an ivory blouse. With the smile of an old acquaintance and her hand extended, she approached. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’m so pleased you could come.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The pleasure is mine, Miss Urbanova.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I doubt that. But please, call me Anna.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Before the Count could reply, there was a knock at the door. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Ah,” she said. “Here we are.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Swinging the door open, she stepped aside to let Oleg from room service pass. When Oleg caught sight of the Count, he nearly ran his dinner cart into the competing arrangements of flowers. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Perhaps over there by the window,” suggested the actress. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes, Miss Urbanova,” said Oleg, who, having regained his composure, set a table for two, lit a candle, and backed out the door. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The actress turned to the Count. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Have you eaten? I’ve been in two restaurants and a bar today and haven’t had a bite. I’m absolutely starving. Won’t you join me?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Certainly.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The Count pulled back a chair for his hostess and, as he took his seat on the opposite side of the candle, the borzois looked back from their windows. Presumably, here was a scene that neither of the dogs could have</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p119"></a>anticipated earlier that day. But having long since lost interest in the fickle course of human affairs, they dropped to the floor and trotted back to the drawing room without a second glance. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The actress watched them retire a little wistfully. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I confess that I am not a dog lover.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Then why do you have them?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“They were . . . a gift.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Ah. From an admirer.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">She responded with a wry smile. “I would have settled for a necklace.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The Count returned the smile. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well,” she said. “Let’s see what we’ve got.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Removing the silver dome from the serving plate, the actress revealed one of Emile’s signature dishes: whole bass roasted with black olives, fennel, and lemon. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Lovely,” she said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">And the Count could not agree more. For by setting his oven to 450˚, Emile ensured that the flesh of the fish was tender, the fennel aromatic, and the lemon slices blackened and crisp. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“So, two restaurants and a bar without having a bite to eat . . .” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Thus began the Count, with the natural intention of letting the actress recount her day while he prepared her plate. But before he could lift a finger, she had taken the knife and serving fork in hand. And as she began to relate the professional obligations that had commandeered her afternoon, she scored the fish’s spine with the tip of the knife and made diagonal cuts at its head and tail. Then slipping the serving fork between the fish’s spine and its flesh, she deftly liberated the filet. In a few succinct movements, she had served portions of the fennel and olives, and topped the filet with the charred lemon. Handing the Count this perfectly prepared plate, she plucked the spine from the fish and served herself the second filet with accompaniments—an operation that took no more than a minute. Then placing the serving utensils on the platter, she turned her attention to the wine. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">Good God, </i> thought the Count. So engrossed had he been in watching her technique, he had neglected his own responsibilities. Leaping from his chair, he took the bottle by the neck. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“May I?” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p120"></a>“Thank you.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">As the Count poured the wine, he noted it was a dry Montrachet, the perfect complement to Emile’s bass and clearly the handiwork of Andrey. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The Count raised his glass to his hostess. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I must say that you deboned that fish like an expert.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">She laughed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Is that a compliment?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Of course it’s a compliment! Well. At least, it was intended as one. . . .” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“In that case, thank you. But I wouldn’t make too much of it. I was raised in a fishing village on the Black Sea, so I’ve tied more than my share of knots and filleted more than my share of fish.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You could do worse than dining on fish every night.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That’s true. But when you live in a fisherman’s house, you tend to eat what can’t be sold. So more often than not, we dined on flatfish and bream.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The bounty of the sea . . .” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The  <i class="calibre3">bottom</i> of the sea.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">And with that disarming memory, Anna Urbanova was suddenly describing how as a girl she would steal away from her mother at dusk and wind her way down the sloping streets of her village so that she could meet her father on the beach and help him mend his nets. And as she talked, the Count had to acknowledge once again the virtues of withholding judgment. </p>
<p class="calibre1">After all, what can a first impression tell us about someone we’ve just met for a minute in the lobby of a hotel? For that matter, what can a first impression tell us about anyone? Why, no more than a chord can tell us about Beethoven, or a brushstroke about Botticelli. By their very nature, human beings are so capricious, so complex, so delightfully contradictory, that they deserve not only our consideration, but our  <i class="calibre3">reconsideration</i>—and our unwavering determination to withhold our opinion until we have engaged with them in every possible setting at every possible hour. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Take the simple case of Anna Urbanova’s voice. In the context of the lobby, where the actress was struggling to rein in her hounds, the hoarseness of her voice had given the impression of an imperious young lady prone to shouting. Very well. But here in suite 208 in the company of charred lemons, French wine, and memories of the sea, her voice was</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p121"></a>revealed as that of a woman whose profession rarely allowed her the chance for repose, never mind the enjoyment of a decent meal. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As the Count refilled their glasses, he was struck by a memory of his own that seemed in keeping with the conversation. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I spent a good part of my youth in the province of Nizhny Novgorod,” </p>
<p class="calibre1">he said, “which happens to be the world capital of the apple. In Nizhny Novgorod, there are not simply apple trees scattered about the countryside; there are  <i class="calibre3">forests</i> of apple trees—forests as wild and ancient as Russia itself</p>
<p class="calibre1">—in which apples grow in every color of the rainbow and in sizes ranging from a walnut to a cannonball.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I take it you ate your fair share of apples.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh, we’d find them tucked in our omelets at breakfast, floating in our soups at lunch, and stuffed in our pheasants at dinner. Come Christmas, we had eaten every single variety the woods had to offer.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The Count was about to lift his glass to toast the comprehensiveness of their apple eating, when he waved a self-correcting finger. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Actually, there was one apple that we did not eat. . . .” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The actress raised one of her bedeviling eyebrows. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Which?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“According to local lore, hidden deep within the forest was a tree with apples as black as coal—and if you could find this tree and eat of its fruit, you could start your life anew.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The Count took a generous drink of the Montrachet, pleased to have summoned this little folktale from the past. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“So would you?” the actress asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Would I what?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“If you found that apple hidden in the forest, would you take a bite?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The Count put his glass on the table and shook his head. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“There’s certainly some allure to the idea of a fresh start; but how could I relinquish my memories of home, of my sister, of my school years.” The Count gestured to the table. “How could I relinquish my memory of this?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">And Anna Urbanova, having put her napkin on her plate and pushed back her chair, came round the table, took the Count by the collar, and kissed him on the mouth. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p122"></a><img class="calibre2" src="index-122_1.jpg"/></p>
<p class="calibre1">Ever since reading her note in the Shalyapin Bar, the Count had felt one step behind Miss Urbanova. The casual reception in her suite, the candlelit dinner for two, the deboning of the fish followed by memories of childhood</p>
<p class="calibre1">—he had not anticipated any one of these developments. Certainly he had been caught off guard by the kiss. And now, here she was strolling into her bedroom, unbuttoning her blouse, and letting it slip to the floor with a delicate whoosh. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As a young man, the Count had prided himself on being one step ahead. </p>

<p class="calibre1">For one, it was so much more relaxing. To be a step ahead in matters of romance requires constant vigilance. If one hopes to make a successful advance, one must be mindful of every utterance, attend to every gesture, and take note of every look. In other words, to be a step ahead in romance is exhausting. But to be a step behind? To be seduced? Why, that was a matter of leaning back in one’s chair, sipping one’s wine, and responding to a query with the very first thought that has popped into one’s head. </p>
<p class="calibre1">And yet, paradoxically, if being a step behind was more relaxing than being a step ahead, it was also more exciting. From his relaxed position, the one-step-behinder imagines that his evening with a new acquaintance will transpire like any other—with a little chit, a little chat, and a friendly goodnight at the door. But halfway through dinner there is an unexpected compliment and an accidental brushing of fingers against one’s hand; there is a tender admission and a self-effacing laugh; then suddenly a kiss. </p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="p123"></a><img class="calibre2" src="index-123_1.jpg"/></p>
<p class="calibre1">experiences when at one in the morning a woman rolling on her side utters unambiguously: “As you go, be sure to draw the curtains.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Suffice it to say that once the Count’s clothes had been gathered, the curtains were dutifully drawn. What’s more, before he had tiptoed to the door half dressed, he took a moment to ensure that the actress’s ivory blouse had been picked off the floor and hung on its hanger. After all, as the Count himself had observed just hours before: the best-bred dogs belong in the surest hands. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The sound of the door clicking shut behind you . . . </p>
<p class="calibre1">The Count wasn’t sure he had ever heard it before, exactly. In tone it was delicate and unobtrusive; and yet, it had a definitive suggestion of dismissal—which was apt to put one in a philosophical frame of mind. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Even if a person generally frowned upon rude and abrupt behavior, under the circumstances he might have to admit a certain rough justice upon finding himself in an empty hallway with his shoes in his hand and his shirt untucked—as the woman he’s just left falls soundly asleep. For if a man has had the good fortune to be plucked from the crowd by an impetuous beauty, shouldn’t he expect to be sent on his way without ceremony? </p>
<p class="calibre1">Well, maybe so. But standing in the empty corridor across from a half-eaten bowl of borscht, the Count felt less like a philosopher than a ghost. </p>
