<body><p class="calibre1">“Richard,” said the Count in some surprise, “you’re not asking me to spy on my country.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What? Spy on your country? Absolutely not, Alexander. I like to think of it more as a form of cosmopolitan gossip. You know: who was invited to the dance and who showed up uninvited; who was holding hands in the corner; and who got hot under the collar. The typical topics of a Sunday morning breakfast anywhere in the world. And in exchange for these sorts of trifles, we could prove generous to a fault. . . .” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The Count smiled. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Richard, I am no more inclined to gossip than I am to spy. So, let’s not speak of this again and we shall remain the best of friends.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“To the best of friends then,” said Richard, clinking the Count’s glass with his own. </p>
<p class="calibre1">And for the next hour, the two men set aside the game of tennis and spoke instead of their lives. The Count spoke of Sofia, who was making wonderful strides at the Conservatory, and who remained so thoughtful and quiet. Richard spoke of his boys, who were making wonderful strides in the nursery, and who remained neither thoughtful nor quiet. They spoke of Paris and Tolstoy and Carnegie Hall. Then at nine o’clock, these two kindred spirits rose from their seats. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It’s probably best if you see yourself out,” said Richard. “Oh, and should it ever come up, you and Professor Sirovich had a lengthy debate on the future of the sonnet. You were in favor, he was against.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">After they’d shaken hands, the Count watched Richard disappear into the bedroom, then he turned toward the door to let himself out. But as he passed the grandfather clock, he hesitated. How loyally it had stood in his grandmother’s drawing room and sounded the time for tea, for supper, for bed. On Christmas Eve, it had signaled the moment when the Count and his sister could slide apart the seamless doors. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Opening the narrow glass door in the clock’s cabinet, the Count reached inside and found the little key still on its hook. Inserting it into the keyhole, the Count wound the clock to its limit, set the time, and gave the pendulum a nudge, thinking:  <i class="calibre3">Let the old man keep time for a few hours more. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p343"></a>Almost nine months later, on the third of March 1953, the man known variously as Dear Father, Vozhd, Koba, Soso, or simply Stalin would die in his Kuntsevo residence in the aftermath of a stroke. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The following day, workmen and trucks laden down with flowers arrived at the Palace of Unions on Theatre Square, and within a matter of hours the building’s facade was adorned with a portrait of Stalin three stories high. </p>
<p class="calibre1">On the sixth, Harrison Salisbury, the new Moscow bureau chief of  <i class="calibre3">The</i> <i class="calibre3">New York Times</i>, stood in the Count’s old rooms (now occupied by the Mexican chargé d’affaires), to watch as members of the Presidium arrived in a cavalcade of ZIM limousines and as Soso’s coffin, taken from a bright blue ambulance, was borne ceremoniously inside. And on the seventh, when the Palace of Unions was opened to the public, Salisbury watched in some amazement as the line of citizens waiting to pay their respects stretched five miles across the city. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Why, many Western observers wondered, would over a million citizens stand in line to see the corpse of a tyrant? The flippant said it must have been to ensure that he was actually dead; but such a remark did not do justice to the men and women who waited and wept. In point of fact, legions mourned the loss of the man who had led them to victory in the Great Patriotic War against the forces of Hitler; legions more mourned the loss of the man who had so single-mindedly driven Russia to become a world power; while others simply wept in recognition that a new era of uncertainty had begun. </p>
<p class="calibre1">For, of course, Richard’s prediction proved perfectly right. When Soso breathed his last, there was no plan of succession, no obvious designee. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Within the Presidium there were eight different men who could reasonably claim the right to lead: Minister of Security Beria, Minister of the Armed Forces Bulganin, Deputy Chairman of the Council of Ministers Malenkov, Minister of Foreign Trade Mikoyan, Foreign Minister Molotov, Secretariat members Kaganovich and Voroshilov, and even former mayor of Moscow Nikita Khrushchev—that blunt, brutish, and bald apparatchik who not long before had perfected the five-story concrete apartment building. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Much to the relief of the West, it seemed in the aftermath of the funeral that the man most likely to prevail was the progressive internationalist and outspoken critic of nuclear arms, Malenkov—because, like Stalin, he was</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p344"></a><img class="calibre2" src="index-344_1.jpg"/></p>
<p class="calibre1">appointed as both Premier of the Party and General Secretary of the Central Committee. But a consensus quickly formed within the Party’s upper ranks that no one man should ever be allowed to simultaneously hold both of these positions again. So ten days later, Party Premier Malenkov was forced to pass his chairmanship of the Secretariat to the conservative Khrushchev, setting the stage for a duumvirate of antagonists—a delicate balance of authority between two men of contrary views and ambiguous alliances, which would keep the world guessing for a few years to come. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“How can anyone live his life in expectation of the Latter?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Despite having announced that he would have no more time for appointments that evening, when the Count asked this question, he was in Anna Urbanova’s bed. . . . </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I know there is something quixotic in dreaming of the Former,” he continued, “but when all is said and done, if the Former is even a remote possibility, then how can one submit to the likelihood of the Latter? To do so would be contrary to the human spirit. So fundamental is our desire to catch a glimpse of another way of life, or to share a glimpse of our way of life with another, that even when the forces of the Latter have bolted the city’s doors, the forces of the Former will find a means to slip through the cracks.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The Count reached over, borrowed Anna’s cigarette, and took a puff. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Having thought for a moment, he waved the cigarette at the ceiling. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“In recent years, I have waited on Americans who have traveled all the way to Moscow to attend one performance at the Bolshoi. Meanwhile, our haphazard little trio in the Shalyapin will take a stab at any little bit of American music they’ve heard on the radio. These are unquestionably the forces of the Former on display.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The Count took another puff. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“When Emile is in his kitchen, does he cook the Latter? Of course not. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He simmers, sears, and serves the Former. A veal from Vienna, a pigeon from Paris, or a seafood stew from the south of France. Or consider the case of Viktor Stepanovich—” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You’re not going to start in on the moths of Manchester again?” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p345"></a>“No,” said the Count peevishly. “I am making a different point entirely. </p>
<p class="calibre1">When Viktor and Sofia sit down at the piano, do they play Mussorgsky, Mussorgsky, and Mussorgsky? No. They play Bach and Beethoven, Rossini and Puccini, while at Carnegie Hall the audience responds to Horowitz’s performance of Tchaikovsky with thunderous applause.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The Count turned on his side to study the actress. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You’re keeping unusually quiet,” he said, returning her cigarette. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Perhaps you don’t agree?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Anna took a drag and slowly exhaled. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It’s not that I disagree with you, Sasha. But I’m not so sure that one can simply dance away one’s life to the tune of the Former, as you call it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Certain realities must be faced wherever you live, and in Russia that may mean a bit of bending to the Latter. Take your beloved bouillabaisse, or that ovation in Carnegie Hall. It is no coincidence that the cities from which your examples spring are port cities: Marseille and New York. I daresay, you could find similar examples in Shanghai and Rotterdam. But Moscow is not a port, my love. At the center of all that is Russia—of its culture, its psychology, and perhaps, its destiny—stands the Kremlin, a walled fortress a thousand years old and four hundred miles from sea. Physically speaking, its walls are no longer high enough to fend off attack; and yet, they still cast a shadow across the entire country.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The Count rolled onto his back and stared at the ceiling. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Sasha, I know you don’t want to accept the notion that Russia may be inherently inward looking, but do you think in America they are even having this conversation? Wondering if the gates of New York are about to be opened or closed? Wondering if the Former is more likely than the Latter? By all appearances, America was founded on the Former. They don’t even know what the Latter is.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You sound as if you dreamed of living in America.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Everyone dreams of living in America.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That’s ridiculous.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Ridiculous? Half of the inhabitants of Europe would move there tomorrow just for the conveniences.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Conveniences! What conveniences?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Turning on her side, Anna tamped out her cigarette, opened the drawer in the bedside table, and produced a large American magazine, which, the</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p346"></a>Count noted, was rather presumptuously entitled  <i class="calibre3">LIFE</i>. Flipping through the pages, Anna began pointing to various brightly colored photographs. Each one seemed to show the same woman in a different dress smiling before some newfangled contraption. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Dishwashing machines. Clothes-washing machines. Vacuum cleaners. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Toasters. Televisions. And look here, an automatic garage door.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What is an automatic garage door?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It is a garage door that opens and closes itself on your behalf. What do you think of that?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I think if I were a garage door, I should rather miss the old days.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Anna lit another cigarette and handed it to the Count. He took a drag and watched the smoke spiral toward the ceiling where the Muses looked down from the clouds. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’ll tell you what is convenient,” he said after a moment. “To sleep until noon and have someone bring you your breakfast on a tray. To cancel an appointment at the very last minute. To keep a carriage waiting at the door of one party, so that on a moment’s notice it can whisk you away to another. </p>
<p class="calibre1">To sidestep marriage in your youth and put off having children altogether. </p>
<p class="calibre1">These are the greatest of conveniences, Anushka—and at one time, I had them all. But in the end, it has been the inconveniences that have mattered to me most.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Anna Urbanova took the cigarette from the Count’s fingers, dropped it in a water glass, and kissed him on the nose. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p347"></a><b class="calibre4">1953</b></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3"><b class="calibre4">Apostles and Apostates</b></i></p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre4">L</b>ike the wheeling of the stars,” muttered the Count as he paced. </p>
<p class="calibre1">That is how time passes when one is left waiting unaccountably. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The hours become interminable. The minutes relentless. And the seconds? </p>
<p class="calibre1">Why, not only does every last one of them demand its moment on the stage, it insists upon making a soliloquy full of weighty pauses and artful hesitations and then leaps into an encore at the slightest hint of applause. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But hadn’t the Count once waxed poetic over how slowly the stars advanced? Hadn’t he rhapsodized over how the constellations seemed to halt in their course when on a warm summer’s night one lay on one’s back and listened for footsteps in the grass—as if nature itself were conspiring to lengthen the last few hours before daybreak, so that they could be savored to the utmost? </p>
<p class="calibre1">Well, yes. Certainly that was the case when one was twenty-two and waiting for a young lady in a meadow—having climbed the ivy and rapped on the glass. But to keep a man waiting when he is sixty-three? When his hair has thinned, his joints have stiffened, and his every breath might be his last? There is such a thing as courtesy, after all. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It must be nearly one in the morning, calculated the Count. The performance was scheduled to end by eleven. The reception by twelve. </p>
<p class="calibre1">They should have been here half an hour ago. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Are there no taxis left in Moscow? No trolley cars?” he wondered aloud. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Or had they stopped somewhere on the way home . . . ? Was it possible that in passing a café they could not resist the impulse to slip inside and share a pastry while he waited and waited and waited? Could they have</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p348"></a><img class="calibre2" src="index-348_1.jpg"/></p>
<p class="calibre1">been so heartless? (If so, they dare not attempt to hide the fact, for he could tell if a pastry had been eaten from a distance of fifty feet!) The Count paused in his pacing to peek behind the Ambassador, where he had carefully hidden the Dom Pérignon. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Preparing for a  <i class="calibre3">potential</i> celebration is a tricky business. If Fortune smiles, then one must be ready to hit the ceiling with the cork. But if Fortune shrugs, then one must be prepared to act as if this were just another night, one of no particular consequence—and then later sink the unopened bottle to the bottom of the sea. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The Count stuck his hand into the bucket. The ice was nearly half melted and the temperature of the water a perfect 50˚. If they did not return soon, the temperature would become so tepid that the bottle  <i class="calibre3">belonged</i> at the bottom of the sea. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Well, it would serve them right. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But as the Count withdrew his hand and stood to his full height, he heard an extraordinary sound emanating from the next room. It was the chime of the twice-tolling clock. Reliable Breguet announcing the stroke of midnight. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Impossible! The Count had been waiting for at least two hours. He had paced over twenty miles. It had to be half past one. Not a minute earlier. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Perhaps reliable Breguet was no longer quite so reliable,” muttered the Count. After all, the clock was over fifty years old, and even the finest timepieces must be subject to the ravages of Time. Cogs will eventually lose their coginess just as springs will lose their springiness. But as the Count was having this thought, through the little window in the eaves he heard a clock tower in the distance tolling once, then twice, then thrice. . . . </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes, yes,” he said, collapsing into his chair. “You’ve made your point.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Apparently, this was destined to be a day of exasperations. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Earlier that afternoon, the Boyarsky’s staff had been assembled by the assistant manager so that he could introduce new procedures for the taking, placing, and billing of orders. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Henceforth, he explained, when a waiter took an order, he would write it on a pad designed for this purpose. Leaving the table, he would bring the</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p349"></a>order to the bookkeeper, who, having made an entry in his ledger, would issue a cooking slip for the kitchen. In the kitchen, a corresponding entry would be made in the cooking log, at which point the cooking could commence. When the food was ready for consumption, a confirmation slip would be issued by the kitchen to the bookkeeper, who in turn would provide a stamped receipt to the waiter authorizing the retrieval of the food. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Thus, a few minutes later, the waiter would be able to make the appropriate notation on his notepad confirming that that dish which had been ordered, logged, cooked, and retrieved was finally on the table. . . . </p>
<p class="calibre1">Now, in all of Russia, there was no greater admirer of the written word than Count Alexander Ilyich Rostov. In his time, he had seen a couplet of Pushkin’s sway a hesitant heart. He had watched as a single passage from Dostoevsky roused one man to action and another to indifference—in the very same hour. He certainly viewed it as providential that when Socrates held forth in the agora and Jesus on the Mount, someone in the audience had the presence of mind to set their words down for posterity. So let us agree that the Count’s concerns with this new regimen were not grounded in some distaste for pencils and paper. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Rather, it was a matter of context. For if one has chosen to dine at the Piazza, one should expect to have one’s waiter leaning over the table and scratching away on his little pad. But ever since the Count had become headwaiter of the Boyarsky, its customers could expect their server to look them in the eye, answer their questions, offer recommendations, and flawlessly record their preferences—without ever taking his hands from behind his back. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Naturally, this would not do. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As luck would have it, in the middle of the second seating the Count noticed the Bishop stopping momentarily at the Boyarsky’s door. So, having been raised on the principle that civilized men should share their</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p350"></a>concerns and proceed in the spirit of collegial common sense, the Count crossed the dining room and followed the Bishop into the hall. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Manager Leplevsky!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Headwaiter Rostov,” said the Bishop, showing a hint of surprise at being hailed by the Count. “What can I do for you . . . ?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It’s really such a small matter that I hardly wish to trouble you with it.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“If the matter concerns the hotel, then it concerns me.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Just so,” agreed the Count. “Now, I assure you, Manager Leplevsky, that in all of Russia there is no greater admirer of the written word . . .” And having thus broached the subject, the Count went on to applaud the couplets of Pushkin, the paragraphs of Dostoevsky, and the transcriptions of Socrates and Jesus. Then he explained the threat that pencils and pads posed to the Boyarsky’s tradition of romantic elegance. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Can you imagine,” concluded the Count with a glint in his eye, “if when you sought your wife’s hand, you had to issue your proposal with the stamp of a presiding agency, and were then required to take down her response on a little pad of paper in triplicate—so that you could give one copy to her, one to her father, and one to the family priest?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">But even as the Count was delivering this quip, he was reminded by the expression on the Bishop’s face that one should generally avoid quips in which a man’s marriage played a part. . . . </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I don’t see that my wife has anything to do with this,” said the Bishop. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No,” agreed the Count. “That was poorly put. What I am trying to say is that Andrey, Emile, and I—” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“So you are bringing this grievance on behalf of Maître d’ Duras and Chef Zhukovsky?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well, no. I have hailed you of my own accord. And it is not a grievance per se. But the three of us are dedicated to ensuring the satisfaction of the Boyarsky’s customers.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The Bishop smiled. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Of course. And I am sure that all three of you have your own special concerns given your specific duties. But as  <i class="calibre3">manager</i> of the Metropol, I am the one who must ensure that  <i class="calibre3">every</i> aspect of the hotel meets a standard of perfection; and  <i class="calibre3">that</i> requires a vigilant attention to the elimination of all discrepancies.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The Count was confused. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p351"></a><img class="calibre2" src="index-351_1.jpg"/></p>
<p class="calibre1">“Discrepancies? What sort of discrepancies?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“All kinds of discrepancies. One day, there may be a discrepancy between how many onions arrived in the kitchen and how many were served in the stew. On another, there may be a discrepancy between how many glasses of wine were ordered and how many poured.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The Count grew cold. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You are speaking of thievery.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Am I?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The two men stared at each other for a moment, then the Bishop smiled narrowly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Given your shared dedication, please feel free to relate our conversation to Chef Zhukovsky and Maître d’ Duras at your earliest convenience.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The Count gritted his teeth. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Rest assured, I shall do so word for word tomorrow at our daily meeting.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The Bishop studied the Count. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You have a daily meeting . . . ?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Suffice it to say that at the Boyarsky’s second seating, the customers were shocked, bemused, and beside themselves once again as slips of paper flew about the dining room like pheasants at the crack of a rifle. And after enduring all of that, here was the Count sitting alone in his study counting the minutes. </p>
<p class="calibre1">After drumming his fingers on the armrest of his chair, the Count rose and recommenced his pacing while humming Mozart’s Piano Sonata No. 1</p>
<p class="calibre1">in C major. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Dum de dum de dum,” he hummed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It was a delightful composition, you had to admit, and one quite well suited to his daughter’s personality. The first movement had the tempo of Sofia coming home from school at the age of ten with fifteen things to relate. Without taking the time to explain who was who or what was what, she would zip along, punctuating her report with  <i class="calibre3">and then, and then, and</i> <i class="calibre3">then, and then</i>. In the second movement, the sonata transitioned to an</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p352"></a>andante tempo more in keeping with Sofia at seventeen, when she would welcome thunderstorms on Saturday afternoons so that she could sit in their study with a book in her lap or a recording on the phonograph. In the third movement, with its fleet pace and pointillist style, you could almost hear her at the age of thirteen, running down the hotel’s stairs, freezing on a landing momentarily to let someone pass, and then bolting brightly ahead. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Yes, it was a delightful composition. There was no debating that. But was it  <i class="calibre3">too</i> delightful? Would it be viewed by the judges as insufficiently weighty for the times? When Sofia had selected the composition, the Count had attempted to signal his concerns diplomatically, by referring to the piece as “pleasant” and “quite diverting”; and then he had kept his peace. </p>
<p class="calibre1">For it is the role of the parent to express his concerns and then take three steps back. Not one, mind you, not two, but three. Or maybe four. (But by no means five.) Yes, a parent should share his hesitations and then take three or four steps back, so that the child can make a decision by herself—</p>
<p class="calibre1">even when that decision may lead to disappointment. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But wait! </p>
<p class="calibre1">What was that? </p>
<p class="calibre1">As the Count turned, the closet door swung open and Anna charged into the study, dragging Sofia behind her. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“She won!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">For the first time in twenty years, the Count let out a shout: “Ha-ha!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He embraced Anna for delivering the news. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Then he embraced Sofia for winning. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Then he embraced Anna again. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We’re sorry we’re so late,” said Anna breathlessly. “But they wouldn’t let her leave the reception.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Don’t think of it for a minute! I hadn’t even noticed the time. But sit, sit, sit, and tell me everything.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Offering the ladies the high-back chairs, the Count perched himself on the edge of the Ambassador and trained his gaze on Sofia, expectantly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Smiling shyly, Sofia deferred to Anna. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It was incredible,” said the actress. “There were five performers before Sofia. Two violinists, a cellist—” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Where was it? Which venue?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“In the Grand Hall.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p353"></a>“I know it well. Designed by Zagorsky at the turn of the century. How crowded was it? Who was there?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Anna furrowed her brow. Sofia laughed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Papa. Let her tell it.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“All right, all right.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">So the Count did as he was instructed: He let Anna tell it. And she told how there were five performers before Sofia: two violinists, a cellist, a French-horn player, and another pianist. All five had done the Conservatory proud, comporting themselves professionally and playing their instruments with precision. Two pieces by Tchaikovsky, two by Rimsky-Korsakov, and something by Borodin. But then it was Sofia’s turn. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I tell you, Sasha, there was an audible gasp when she appeared. She crossed the stage to the piano without the slightest rustle of her dress. It was as if she were floating.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You taught me that, Aunt Anna.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No, no, Sofia. The manner in which you entered is  <i class="calibre3">unteachable</i>.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Without a doubt,” agreed the Count. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well. When the director announced that Sofia would be playing Mozart’s Piano Sonata No. 1, there was some muttering and a shifting of chairs. But the moment she began to play, they were overcome.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I knew it. Didn’t I say so? Didn’t I say that a little Mozart is never out of step?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Papa . . .” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“She played with such tenderness,” Anna continued, “such joy, that the audience was won over from the start. There was a smile on every face in every row, I tell you. And the applause when she finished! If only you could have heard it, Sasha. It shook the dust from the chandeliers.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The Count clapped his own hands and rubbed them together. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“How many musicians performed after Sofia?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It didn’t matter. The competition was over and everyone knew it. The poor boy who was up next practically had to be dragged onstage. And then, she was the belle of the reception, being toasted from every corner.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“<i class="calibre3">Mon Dieu! </i>” exclaimed the Count, leaping to his feet. “I nearly forgot!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He shoved aside the Ambassador and produced the bucket with the champagne. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“<i class="calibre3">Voilà! </i>” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p354"></a>As his hand dipped in the water, the Count could tell the temperature had climbed to 53˚, but what did  <i class="calibre3">that</i> matter. With a single twist of the fingers he spun the foil off the bottle, then to the ceiling with the cork! The champagne flowed over his hands and they all laughed. He filled two flutes for the ladies and a wine glass for himself. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“To Sofia,” he said. “Let tonight mark the beginning of a grand adventure—one that is sure to take her far and wide.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Papa,” she said with a blush. “It was just a school competition.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Just a school competition! It is one of the intrinsic limitations of being young, my dear, that you can never tell when a grand adventure has just begun. But as a man of experience, you may take my word that—” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Suddenly Anna silenced the Count by holding up her hand. She looked to the closet door. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Did you hear that?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The three stood motionless. Sure enough, though muffled, they could hear the sound of a voice. Someone must have been at the bedroom door. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’ll find out who it is,” whispered the Count. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Andrey let out a gasp. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The Count drew in a breath. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Emile dropped the cake. </p>
<p class="calibre1">And the evening might have come to an end right then and there, but for Andrey’s instinctive inability to let an object fall to the floor. With the lightest of steps and his fingers outstretched, the onetime juggler caught the torte in midair. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As Andrey breathed a sigh of relief and Emile stared with his mouth open, the Count attempted to act matter-of-factly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Why, Andrey, Emile, what a pleasant surprise. . . .” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Taking his cue from the Count, Andrey acted as if nothing out of the ordinary had just happened. “Emile made a little something for Sofia in</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p355"></a>anticipation of her victory,” he said. “Please give her our heartfelt congratulations.” Then placing the cake gently on the Grand Duke’s desk, Andrey turned to the door. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But Emile didn’t budge. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Alexander Ilyich,” he demanded: “What in the name of Ivan were you doing in the closet?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“In the closet?” asked the Count. “Why, I . . . I was . . .” His voice trailed off diminuendo. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Andrey offered a sympathetic smile and then made a little sweeping motion with his hands, as if to say:  <i class="calibre3">The world is wide, and wondrous are the</i> <i class="calibre3">ways of men</i>.  <i class="calibre3"> . . . </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">But Emile furrowed his brow at Andrey, as if to say:  <i class="calibre3">Nonsense. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">The Count looked from one member of the Triumvirate to the other. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Where are my manners?” he said at last. “Sofia will be delighted to see you both. Please. Come this way.” Then he gestured with a welcoming hand to the closet. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Emile looked at the Count as if he’d lost his mind. But Andrey, who could never hesitate before a well-mannered invitation, picked up the cake and took a step toward the closet door. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Emile let out a grunt of exasperation. “If we’re going in,” he said to Andrey, “then you’d better watch out for the frosting on the sleeves.” So the maître d’ passed Emile the cake and carefully parted the Count’s jackets with his delicate hands. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Emerging on the other side, Andrey’s surprise at seeing the Count’s study for the first time was immediately displaced by the sight of Sofia. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“<i class="calibre3">Notre champion! </i>” he said, taking her by the arms and kissing her on both cheeks. For Emile, however, the surprise at seeing the Count’s study was displaced by the even greater surprise of finding the film star Anna Urbanova standing inside it. For unbeknownst to the Triumvirate, the chef had seen every single one of her movies, and generally from the second row. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Noting Emile’s starstruck expression, Andrey took a quick step forward and put his hands under the cake. But Emile did not lose his grip this time. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Rather, he suddenly thrust the cake toward Anna, as if he had baked it for her. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Thank you so much,” she said. “But isn’t that for Sofia?” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p356"></a>Emile blushed from his shoulders to the top of his balding head and turned to Sofia. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I made your favorite,” he said. “A Dobos torte with chocolate cream.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Thank you, Uncle Emile.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It is in the shape of a piano,” he added. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As Emile produced his chopper from his apron string and proceeded to slice the cake, the Count took two more glasses from the Ambassador and filled them with champagne. The story of Sofia’s victory was told again and the perfection of her performance was compared by Anna to the perfection of Emile’s cake. As the chef began explaining to the actress the intricate process by which one makes such a torte, Andrey was recalling for Sofia’s benefit the night many years ago when he and several others had toasted the Count’s arrival on the sixth floor. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Do you remember, Alexander?” </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">“</i> As if it were yesterday,” replied the Count with a smile. “You did the honors with the brandy that night, my friend; and Marina was here along with Vasily. . . .” </p>
<p class="calibre1">As if by an act of magic, at the very instant the Count said Vasily’s name, the concierge stepped through the closet door. In military fashion, he clicked his heels and greeted those assembled in rapid succession without showing the slightest indication of surprise as to their whereabouts:</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Miss Urbanova. Sofia. Andrey. Emile.” Then turning to the Count, he said: “Alexander Ilyich, may I have a word . . . ?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">From the manner in which Vasily asked the question, it was clear that he wished to take the Count aside. But as the Count’s study was but a hundred foot square, they could only step about three feet away from the others in order to secure their privacy—an action that was immediately rendered inconsequential when the other four members of the party moved a similar distance in a similar direction. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I wish to inform you,” said Vasily (in a manner sort of  <i class="calibre3">entre nous</i>), </p>
<p class="calibre1">“that the hotel’s manager is on his way.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">It was the Count’s turn to express surprise. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“On his way where?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“On his way here. Or rather . . . there,” said Vasily, pointing back toward the Count’s bedroom. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But for what possible reason?” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p357"></a>Vasily explained that as he was reviewing the next night’s reservations, he happened to notice the Bishop lingering in the lobby. When a few minutes later a rather  <i class="calibre3">petit</i> gentleman wearing a brimmed hat approached the front desk and asked for the Count by name, the Bishop introduced himself, indicated that he had been expecting the visitor, and offered to show him personally to the Count’s room. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“When was this?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“They were just entering the elevator when I took to the stairs; but they were accompanied by Mr. Harriman from suite 215 and the Tarkovs from room 426. Accounting for the stops at the second and fourth floors, I suspect they should be here any second.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Good God!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The members of the party looked to one another. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No one make a sound,” said the Count. Entering the closet, he closed the study door behind him, then he opened the door to his bedroom a little more cautiously than he had the last time. Relieved to find the room empty, he shut the closet door, took up Sofia’s copy of  <i class="calibre3">Fathers and Sons</i>, sat in his desk chair, and tilted back on two legs just in time to hear the knock on the door. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Who is it?” called out the Count. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It is Manager Leplevsky,” called back the Bishop. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The Count let the front legs of his chair drop with a thump and opened the door to reveal the Bishop and a stranger in the hall. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I hope we are not disturbing you,” said the Bishop. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well, it is a rather unusual hour for paying a call. . . .” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Of course,” said the Bishop with a smile. “But allow me to introduce you to comrade Frinovsky. He was asking after you in the lobby, so I took the liberty of showing him the way, what with your room’s . . . remoteness.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“How considerate of you,” replied the Count. </p>
<p class="calibre1">When Vasily had noted that comrade Frinovsky was  <i class="calibre3">petit</i>, the Count had assumed the concierge was being colorful in his choice of adjectives. But in point of fact, the word  <i class="calibre3">small</i> would not have been sufficiently diminutive to suggest comrade Frinovsky’s size. When the Count addressed the visitor, he had to resist the temptation of getting down on his haunches. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“How can I be of service to you, Mr. Frinovsky?” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p358"></a>“I am here in regards to your daughter,” Frinovsky explained, taking his little hat from his head. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Sofia?” asked the Count. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes, Sofia. I am the director of the Red October Youth Orchestra. Your daughter was recently brought to our attention as a gifted pianist. In fact, I had the pleasure of attending her performance tonight, which accounts for the lateness of my visit. But with the greatest pleasure, I come to confer upon her a position as our second pianist.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The Youth Orchestra of Moscow!” exclaimed the Count. “How wonderful. Where are you housed?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No. I’m sorry if I haven’t been clear,” explained Frinovsky. “The Red October Youth Orchestra is not in Moscow. It is in Stalingrad.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">After a moment of bewilderment, the Count attempted to compose himself. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“As I said, it is a wonderful offer, Mr. Frinovsky. . . . But I am afraid that Sofia would not be interested.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Frinovsky looked to the Bishop as if he hadn’t understood the Count’s remark. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The Bishop simply shook his head. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But it is not a matter of interest,” Frinovsky said to the Count. “A requisition has been made and an appointment has been granted—by the regional undersecretary of cultural affairs.” The director took a letter from his jacket, handed it to the Count, and reached over to point to the undersecretary’s signature. “As you can see, Sofia is to report to the orchestra on the first of September.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">With a feeling of nausea, the Count read over this letter that, in the most technical of language, welcomed his daughter to an orchestra in an industrial city six hundred miles away. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The Youth Orchestra of Stalingrad,” the Bishop said. “How exciting this must be for you, Alexander Ilyich. . . .” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Looking up from the letter, the Count saw the flash of spite in the Bishop’s smile, and just like that the Count’s feelings of nausea and bewilderment were gone—having been replaced by a cold fury. Standing to his full height, the Count took a step toward the Bishop with every intention of grabbing him by the lapels, or better yet the throat—when the door to the closet opened and Anna Urbanova stepped into the room. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p359"></a>The Count, the Bishop, and the  <i class="calibre3">petit</i> musical director all looked up in surprise. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Crossing gracefully to the Count’s side and delicately placing her hand at the small of his back, Anna studied the expressions of the two men in the doorway then addressed the Bishop with a smile. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Why, Manager Leplevsky, you look as if you’ve never seen a beautiful woman step from a closet before.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I haven’t,” sputtered the Bishop. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Of course,” she said sympathetically. Then she turned her attention to the stranger. “And who have we here?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Before the Bishop or the Count could reply, the little man piped up:</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Comrade Ivan Frinovsky, director of the Red October Youth Orchestra of Stalingrad. It is an honor and a privilege to meet you, comrade Urbanova!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“An honor and a privilege,” echoed Anna with her most disarming smile. “You exaggerate, comrade Frinovsky; but I shan’t hold it against you.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Comrade Frinovsky returned the actress’s smile with a blush. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Here,” she added, “let me help you with your hat.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">For, as a matter of fact, the musical director had folded his hat two times over. Taking it from his hands, Anna gently restored the crown, snapped the brim, and returned the hat in a manner that would be retold by the director a few hundred times in the years to come. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“So, you are the musical director of the Youth Orchestra in Stalingrad?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I am,” he said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Then perhaps you know comrade Nachevko?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">At the mention of the round-faced Minister of Culture, the director stood up so straight he added an inch to his stature. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I have never had the honor.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Panteleimon is a delightful man,” assured Anna, “and a great supporter of youthful artistry. In fact, he has taken a personal interest in Alexander’s daughter, young Sofia.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“A personal interest . . . ?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh, yes. Why, just last night at dinner, he was telling me how exciting it will be to watch her talent develop. I sense he has great plans for her here in the capital.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p360"></a><img class="calibre2" src="index-360_1.jpg"/></p>
<p class="calibre1">“I wasn’t aware. . . .” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The director looked to the Bishop with the expression of one who has been put in an uncomfortable position due to no fault of his own. Turning back to the Count, he delicately retrieved his letter. “If your daughter should ever be interested in performing in Stalingrad,” he said, “I hope you will not hesitate to contact me.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Thank you, comrade Frinovsky,” said the Count. “That’s very gracious of you.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Looking from Anna to the Count and back again, Frinovsky said, “I am so sorry that we have inconvenienced you at such an unsuitable hour.” Then he placed his hat on his head and hurried to the belfry with the Bishop hot on his heels. </p>
<p class="calibre1">When the Count had quietly closed the door, he turned to Anna, whose expression was unusually grave. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“When did the Minister of Culture start taking a personal interest in Sofia?” he asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Tomorrow afternoon,” she replied. “At the latest.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">If those gathered in the Count’s study had good cause to celebrate before the Bishop’s visit, they had even more cause to do so after his departure. In fact, as the Count opened a bottle of brandy, Anna found an American jazz record that Richard had slipped among the classical recordings, and cued it on the phonograph. In the minutes that followed, the brandy was poured liberally, Emile’s cake was eaten in its entirety, the jazz record was played repeatedly, and each of the gentlemen had his turn scuffing the parquet with the ladies in attendance. </p>
<p class="calibre1">When the last of the brandy was dispensed, Emile—who given the hour was nearly in a state of ecstasy—suggested they all head downstairs for another round, a little more dancing, and to bring the festivities to Viktor Stepanovich, who was still on the bandstand in the Piazza. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Emile’s motion was immediately seconded and passed by unanimous vote. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But before we go,” said Sofia, who was a little flushed, “I would like to make a toast: To my guardian angel, my father, and my friend, Count</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p361"></a>Alexander Rostov. A man inclined to see the best in all of us.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Hear! Hear!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“And you needn’t worry, Papa,” Sofia continued. “For no matter who comes knocking at our door, I have no intention of ever leaving the Metropol.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">After joining in a cheer, the members of the gathering emptied their glasses, stumbled through the closet, and exited into the hall. Opening the door to the belfry, the Count gave a slight bow and gestured for everyone to proceed. But just as the Count was about to follow the others into the stairwell, a woman in late middle age with a satchel on her shoulder and a kerchief in her hair stepped from the shadows at the end of the hall. Though the Count had never seen her before, it was clear from her demeanor that she had been waiting to speak with him alone. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Andrey,” the Count called into the belfry, “I’ve forgotten something in the room. You all go ahead. I’ll be down in a moment. . . .” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Only when the last sound of voices had receded down the stairs did the woman approach. In the light, the Count could see that she had an almost severe beauty about her—like one for whom there would be no half measures in matters of the heart. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’m Katerina Litvinova,” she said without a smile. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It took a moment for the Count to realize that this was none other than Mishka’s Katerina, the poet from Kiev whom he had lived with back in the 1920s. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Katerina Litvinova! How extraordinary. To what do I owe—” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Is there somewhere we could talk?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Why, yes . . . Of course . . .” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The Count led Katerina into the bedroom and then, after a moment’s hesitation, took her through the jackets into the study. Apparently, he needn’t have hesitated, for she looked around the room as one who had heard descriptions of it before, nodding lightly to herself as her gaze shifted from the bookcase to the coffee table to the Ambassador. Taking her satchel from her shoulder, she suddenly appeared tired. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Here,” said the Count, offering a chair. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She sat down, putting the satchel in her lap. Then passing a hand over her head, she removed her kerchief, revealing light brown hair cut as short as a man’s. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p362"></a>“It’s Mishka, isn’t it . . . ,” the Count said after a moment. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“When?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“A week ago today.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The Count nodded, as one who had been expecting the news for some time. He didn’t ask Katerina how his old friend had died, and she didn’t offer to tell him. It was plain enough that he had been betrayed by his times. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Were you with him?” asked the Count. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“In Yavas?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">. . . </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I was under the impression that . . .” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I lost my husband some time ago.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’m sorry. I didn’t know. Do you have children . . . ?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">She said it curtly, as if in response to a foolish question; but then she continued more softly. “I received word from Mikhail in January. I went to him in Yavas. We have been together these last six months.” After a moment, she added: “He spoke of you often.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“He was a loyal friend,” said the Count. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“He was a man of devotions,” corrected Katerina. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The Count had been about to remark on Mishka’s propensity for getting into scrapes and his love of pacing, but she had just described his old friend better than he ever had. Mikhail Fyodorovich Mindich was a man of devotions. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“And a fine poet,” the Count added, almost to himself. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“One of two.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The Count looked to Katerina as if he didn’t understand. Then he offered a wistful smile. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’ve never written a poem in my life,” he said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Now, it was Katerina who didn’t understand. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What do you mean? What about  <i class="calibre3">Where Is It Now</i>?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It was Mishka who wrote that poem. In the south parlor at Idlehour . . . </p>
<p class="calibre1">In the summer of 1913 . . .” </p>
<p class="calibre1">As Katerina still looked confused, the Count elaborated. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p363"></a>“What with the revolt of 1905 and the repressions that followed, when we graduated it was still a dangerous time for writing poems of political impatience. Given Mishka’s background, the Okhrana would have swept him up with a broom. So one night—after polishing off a particularly good bottle of Margaux—we decided to publish the poem under my name.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But why yours?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What were they going to do to Count Alexander Rostov—member of the Jockey Club and godson of a counselor to the Tsar?” The Count shook his head. “The irony, of course, is that the life which ended up being saved was mine, not his. But for that poem, they would have shot me back in 1922.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Katerina, who had listened to this story intently, was suddenly holding back tears. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Ah, but there you have him,” she said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">They were both silent as she regained her composure. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I want you to know,” said the Count, “how much I appreciate your coming to tell me in person.” But Katerina dismissed his gratitude. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I came at Mikhail’s request. He asked me to bring you something.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">From her satchel she took out a rectangular package wrapped in plain brown paper and tied with twine. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Taking the package in hand, the Count could tell from its weight that it was a book. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It is his project,” said the Count with a smile. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes,” she said. Then she added with pointed emphasis: “He slaved over it.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The Count nodded to express his understanding and to assure Katerina that he did not take the bestowal lightly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Katerina looked once more around the room with a light shake of the head as if it somehow exemplified the mystery of outcomes; then she said that she should go. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The Count rose to his feet with her, setting Mishka’s project on the chair. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Are you going back to Yavas?” he asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Will you be staying in Moscow?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Where then?” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p364"></a>“Does it matter?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">She turned to go. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Katerina . . .” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Is there anything I can do for you?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Katerina looked surprised at first by the Count’s offer, then ready to dismiss it. But after a moment, she said: “Remember him.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Then she went out the door. </p>


<p class="calibre1">And yet, he had kept the picture all these years. </p>
<p class="calibre1">With a sorrowful smile, the Count set the photograph down and then turned the title leaf to the first page of his old friend’s book. All it contained was a single quotation in a slightly uneven typeset:</p>
<p class="calibre1">And to Adam he said, “Because you have listened to the</p>
<p class="calibre1">voice of your wife, and have eaten of the tree of which I commanded you, ‘You shall not eat of it,’ cursed is the</p>
<p class="calibre1">ground because of you . . . In the sweat of your face you shall eat<b class="calibre4"> BREAD</b> till you return to the ground, for out of it you were taken; you are dust, and to dust you shall return.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">Genesis </i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">3:17–19</i></p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p365"></a>The Count turned to the second page, on which there was also one quotation:</p>
<p class="calibre1">And the tempter came and said to him, “If you are the Son of God, command these stones to become loaves of <b class="calibre4">BREAD</b>.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">But he answered, “It is written, ‘Man shall not live by</p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre4">BREAD</b> alone, but by every word that proceeds from the mouth of God.’” </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">Matthew </i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">4:3–4</i></p>
<p class="calibre1">And then to the third . . . </p>
<p class="calibre1">And he took <b class="calibre4">BREAD</b>, and when he had given thanks he broke it and gave it to them, saying, “This is my body which is given for you. Do this in remembrance of me.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">Luke </i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">22:19</i></p>
<p class="calibre1">As the Count continued turning slowly through the pages, he found himself laughing. For here was Mishka’s project in a nutshell: a compendium of quotations from seminal texts arranged in chronological order, but in each of which the word  <i class="calibre3">bread </i> had been capitalized and printed in bold. Beginning with the Bible, the citations proceeded right through the works of the Greeks and Romans onto the likes of Shakespeare, Milton, and Goethe. But particular tribute was paid to the golden age of Russian literature:</p>
<p class="calibre1">For the sake of propriety, Ivan Yakovlevich put his tailcoat on over his undershirt and, settling at the table, poured out some salt, prepared two onions, took a knife in his hands, and, assuming a significant air, began cutting the <b class="calibre4">BREAD</b>. Having</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p366"></a>cut the loaf in two, he looked into the middle and, to his surprise, saw something white. Ivan Yakovlevich poked</p>
<p class="calibre1">cautiously with his knife and felt with his finger. “Firm!” he said to himself. “What could it be?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He stuck in his fingers and pulled out—a nose! </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">“The Nose” </i></p>

<p class="calibre1">Fyodor Dostoevsky <i class="calibre3"> </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">(1880)</p>
<p class="calibre1">As the Count turned the pages, he smiled in recognition of the characteristic feistiness that Mishka’s project expressed. But following the quote from “The Grand Inquisitor,” there was a second citation from  <i class="calibre3">The</i> <i class="calibre3">Brothers Karamazov</i> from a scene the Count had all but forgotten. It related to the little boy, Ilyushechka—the one who was hounded by his schoolmates until falling dangerously ill. When the boy finally dies, his heartstricken father tells the saintly Alyosha Karamazov that his son had made one final request:</p>
<p class="calibre1">Papa, when they put the dirt on my grave, crumble a crust of <b class="calibre4">BREAD</b> on it so the sparrows will come, and I’ll hear that they’ve come and be glad that I’m not lying alone. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Upon reading this, Alexander Rostov finally broke down and wept. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Certainly, he wept for his friend, that generous yet temperamental soul who only briefly found his moment in time—and who, like this forlorn child, was disinclined to condemn the world for all its injustices. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But, of course, the Count also wept for himself. For despite his friendships with Marina and Andrey and Emile, despite his love for Anna, despite Sofia—that extraordinary blessing that had struck him from the blue</p>
<p class="calibre1">—when Mikhail Fyodorovich Mindich died, there went the last of those</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p369"></a>who had known him as a younger man. Though, as Katerina had so rightfully observed, at least he remained to remember. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Taking a deep breath, the Count attempted to restore his composure, determined to read through the final pages of his old friend’s final discourse. The progression of citations, which had spanned over two thousand years, did not continue much further. For rather than extending into the present, the survey ended in June 1904, with the sentences that Mishka had cut from Chekhov’s letter all those years ago: Here in Berlin, we’ve taken a comfortable room in the best hotel. I am very much enjoying the life here and haven’t eaten so well and with such an appetite in a long time. The <b class="calibre4">BREAD</b> here is amazing, I’ve been stuffing myself with it, the coffee is excellent, and the dinners are beyond words. </p>
<p class="calibre1">People who have never been abroad don’t know how good</p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre4">BREAD</b> can be. . . . </p>
<p class="calibre1">Given the hardships of the 1930s, the Count supposed he could understand why Shalamov (or his superiors) had insisted upon this little bit of censorship—having presumed that Chekhov’s observation could only lead to feelings of discontent or ill will. But the irony, of course, was that Chekhov’s observation was no longer even accurate. For surely, by now, the Russian people knew better than anyone in Europe how good a piece of bread could be. </p>
<p class="calibre1">When the Count closed Mishka’s book, he did not head straight downstairs to join the others. Instead, he remained in his study, lost in thought. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Given the circumstances, an observer might understandably have drawn the conclusion that as the Count sat there he was dwelling on memories of his old friend. But, in fact, he was no longer thinking about Mishka. He was thinking about Katerina. In particular, he was thinking—with a sense of foreboding—that in the course of twenty years this firefly, this pinwheel, this wonder of the world had become a woman who, when asked where she was going, could answer without the slightest hesitation:  <i class="calibre3">Does it matter? </i></p>

<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3"><b class="calibre4">Applause and Acclaim</b></i></p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre4">P</b>aris . . . ?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Or so asked Andrey in the manner of one who cannot quite believe what he has heard. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes,” said Emile. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Paris . . .  <i class="calibre3">France</i>?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Emile furrowed his brow. “Are you drunk? Have you been knocked on the head?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But how?” asked the maître d’. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Emile sat back in his chair and nodded. For here was a question that was worthy of a man of intelligence. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It is a well-known fact that of all the species on earth  <i class="calibre3">Homo sapiens</i> is among the most adaptable. Settle a tribe of them in a desert and they will wrap themselves in cotton, sleep in tents, and travel on the backs of camels; settle them in the Arctic and they will wrap themselves in sealskin, sleep in igloos, and travel by dog-drawn sled. And if you settle them in a Soviet climate? They will learn to make friendly conversation with strangers while waiting in line; they will learn to neatly stack their clothing in their half of the bureau drawer; and they will learn to draw imaginary buildings in their sketchbooks. That is, they will adapt. But certainly one aspect of adaptation for those Russians who had seen Paris before the Revolution was the acceptance that they would never, ever see Paris again. . . . </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Here he is now,” said Emile as the Count came through the door. “Ask him yourself.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Having taken his seat, the Count confirmed that six months hence, on the twenty-first of June, Sofia would be in Paris, France. And when asked how this could possibly have come about, with a shrug the Count</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p372"></a>responded: “VOKS.” That is, the All-Union Society for Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It was now Emile’s turn to express disbelief: “Do we have cultural relations with foreign countries?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Apparently, we are now sending our artists all around the world. In April we are sending the ballet to New York; in May we are sending a dramatic ensemble to London; and in June we are sending the orchestra of the Moscow Conservatory to Minsk, Prague, and Paris—where Sofia will be performing Rachmaninov at the Palais Garnier.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It’s incredible,” said Andrey. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Fantastical,” said Emile. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I know.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The three men laughed, until Emile pointed his chopper at his colleagues:</p>
<p class="calibre1">“But well deserved.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh, absolutely.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Without a doubt.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The three were quiet, each lost for a moment in their respective memories of the City of Light. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Do you think it has changed?” wondered Andrey. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes,” said Emile. “As much as the pyramids.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">And here, the three members of the Triumvirate might have waded into the rose-colored past, but for the fact that the door to Emile’s office swung open and in walked the newest member of the Boyarsky’s daily meeting: the Bishop. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Good afternoon, gentlemen. I’m sorry to keep you waiting. There was business at the front desk that demanded my immediate attention. In the future, please don’t feel the need to congregate until I have arrived.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Emile grunted, semiaudibly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ignoring the chef, the Bishop turned to the Count. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Headwaiter Rostov, isn’t this your day of rest? You shouldn’t feel the need to be in attendance at the daily meeting when you are not scheduled to work.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well informed is well prepared,” said the Count. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Of course.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p373"></a>Some years before, the Bishop had helpfully explained to the Count that while the Metropol’s employees each had their narrow little tasks, the manager alone had to ensure a standard of excellence for the entire hotel. </p>
<p class="calibre1">And to be fair, the Bishop’s personality made him perfectly suited to the task. For whether in the guest rooms, the lobby, or the linen closet on the second floor, no detail was too small, no flaw too immaterial, no moment too inopportune to receive the benefit of the Bishop’s precious, persnickety, and mildly dismissive interference. And that was certainly the case within the walls of the Boyarsky. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The daily meeting commenced with a detailed description of the evening’s special offerings. Naturally, the Bishop had dispensed with the tradition of tasting the specials, on the grounds that the chef knew perfectly well what his food tasted like, and to prepare samples for the staff was both indiscriminate and wasteful. Instead, Emile was instructed to write out a description of the specials by hand. </p>
<p class="calibre1">With another grunt, the chef slid his menu across the table. After inscribing a series of circles, arrows, and  <i class="calibre3">x</i>’s, the Bishop’s pencil paused. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I should think that beets would accompany the pork quite as well as apples,” he reflected. “And if I am not mistaken, Chef Zhukovsky, you still have a bushel of beets in the pantry.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">As the Bishop inserted this improvement into Emile’s menu, the chef cast a furious glance across the table at the man he now referred to as Count Blabbermouth. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Handing the corrected menu back to the chef, the Bishop now turned his attention to the maître d’, who slid the Book across the table. Despite the fact that it was one of the last days of 1953, the Bishop opened the Book to the first page and turned through the weeks of the year one by one. Finally arriving at the present, he scrutinized the evening’s reservations with the tip of his pencil. Then he provided seating instructions to Andrey and slid the Book back. As a final piece of business, the Bishop alerted the maître d’ to the fact that the flowers in the dining room’s centerpiece had begun to wilt. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I noted that as well,” said Andrey. “But I am afraid our flower shop has not been carrying the inventory necessary to ensure a frequent refreshing of the arrangement.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“If you cannot secure flowers of sufficient freshness from Florist Eisenberg, then perhaps it is time to switch to a silk arrangement. That</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p374"></a><img class="calibre2" src="index-374_1.jpg"/></p>
<p class="calibre1">would obviate the necessity for refreshing the arrangement and should have the added benefit of proving more economical.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I shall speak with Florist Eisenberg today,” said Andrey. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Of course.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Once the Bishop had concluded the meeting and Emile had gone off grumbling in search of his bushel of beets, the Count accompanied Andrey to the main staircase. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“<i class="calibre3">À tout à l’heure</i>,” said the maître d’, as he headed down to the flower shop. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“<i class="calibre3">À bientôt</i>,” said the Count as he headed up to his rooms. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But as soon as Andrey had disappeared from sight, the Count was back on the second-floor landing. Spying around the corner to confirm that his friend was gone, the Count hurried to the Boyarsky. Having locked the door behind him, he peeked into the kitchen to confirm that Emile and his staff were otherwise engaged. Only then did he approach the maître d’s podium, open the drawer, cross himself twice, and pull out the 1954 edition of the Book. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Within minutes he had reviewed all the reservations in January and February. He paused at one event scheduled for the Yellow Room in March and at another scheduled for the Red Room in April, but neither would do. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As he moved further into the future, the pages of the Book became increasingly bare. Whole weeks passed without a single entry. The Count began flipping the pages with a quicker pace, and even a hint of desperation</p>
<p class="calibre1">—that is, until he landed on the eleventh of June. Having studied the marginal notes written in Andrey’s delicate script, the Count tapped the entry twice. A combined dinner of the Presidium and the Council of Ministers—two of the most powerful bodies in the Soviet Union. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Returning the Book to its drawer, the Count climbed the stairs to his bedroom, pushed his chair aside, sat on the floor, and for the first time in almost thirty years opened one of the hidden doors in the legs of the Grand Duke’s desk. For while the Count may have resolved to take action on the night of Katerina’s visit six months before, it was only with news of the Conservatory’s goodwill tour that the clock had begun to tick. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p375"></a><img class="calibre2" src="index-375_1.jpg"/></p>
<p class="calibre1">When the Count arrived at the Shalyapin at six o’clock that night, the denizens of the bar were celebrating the misadventures of “Pudgy” Webster, a gregarious if somewhat hapless American who had recently arrived in the capital. Twenty-nine years old and still suffering from that affliction for which he had been nicknamed as a boy, Pudgy had been sent to Russia by his father—the owner of the American Vending Machine Company of Montclair, New Jersey—with strict instructions that he not come home until he had sold a thousand machines. After three weeks, he had finally secured his first meeting with a Party official (the assistant to the manager of the skating rink in Gorky Park), and had thus been convinced by several journalists to sponsor a round of champagne. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Taking a stool at the other end of the bar, the Count accepted a flute from Audrius with a grateful nod and the smile of one who has his own cause for celebration. The designs of men are notoriously subservient to happenstance, hesitation, and haste; but had the Count been given the power to engineer an optimal course of events, he could not have done a better job than Fate was doing on its own. So with a smile on his lips, he raised his glass. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But to toast Fate is to tempt Fate; and sure enough, even as the Count set his flute down on the bar, a gust of frozen air brushed against the nape of his neck, followed by an urgent whisper. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Your Excellency!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Turning on his stool, the Count was surprised to find Viktor Stepanovich standing behind him with frost on his shoulders and snow on his cap. A few months before, Viktor had joined a chamber orchestra and thus was rarely at the hotel in the evening. What’s more, he was panting as if he had just sprinted across the city. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Viktor!” exclaimed the Count. “What is it? You look in a state.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Viktor ignored the remark and began to speak with uncharacteristic impatience. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I know that you are protective of your daughter, Your Excellency, and rightfully so. Such is the prerogative of any parent, and the duty of one who is raising a tender heart. But with all due respect, I think you are making a</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p376"></a><img class="calibre2" src="index-376_1.jpg"/></p>
<p class="calibre1">terrible mistake. She will be graduating in six months, and her chances of receiving a worthy position will only be hampered by your decision.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Viktor,” said the Count, rising from his stool. “I have no idea what you are talking about.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Viktor studied the Count. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You did not instruct Sofia to withdraw her name?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Withdraw her name from what?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I just received a call from Director Vavilov. He informed me that she has declined the invitation to travel with the Conservatory’s orchestra.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Declined the invitation! I assure you, my friend, that I had no idea. In fact, I agree with you hares, hounds, and horses that the brightness of her future  <i class="calibre3">depends</i> upon her performing on that tour.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The two men looked at each other, dumbfounded. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“She must have acted of her own accord,” said the Count after a moment. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But to what end?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He shook his head. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I fear it may be my fault, Viktor. Yesterday afternoon, when we received the news, I made so much of it:  <i class="calibre3">The chance to play Rachmaninov</i> <i class="calibre3">before an audience of thousands in the Palais Garnier! </i> I must have triggered feelings of trepidation. She has a tender heart, as you say; but she also has spunk. She is bound to come around in the weeks ahead.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Viktor took the Count by the sleeve. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But there are no weeks ahead. On Friday, a public announcement will be made describing the orchestra’s itinerary and the musical program. The director will need to have all of his performers in place before the announcement. Assuming that the decision to withdraw Sofia was yours, I gained his assurance that he would wait twenty-four hours before making a new appointment—so that I could try to persuade you. If she has made this decision on her own, then you must speak to her tonight and change her mind. She must come to the defense of her own talent!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">One hour later at table ten of the Boyarsky, with menus perused and orders placed, Sofia looked to the Count expectantly—as it was his turn to play</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p377"></a>first in  <i class="calibre3">Zut</i>. But, despite the fact that he had prepared a promising category</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a href="index_split_006.html#p465">(common uses for wax),*</a> the Count opted instead to summon an untold story from the past. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Have I ever told you about Ribbon Day at the academy?” he began. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes,” Sofia said. “You have.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Furrowing his brow, the Count reviewed all of the conversations that he had ever had with his daughter in chronological order and could find no evidence of having told her the tale before. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I may have mentioned something about Ribbon Day once or twice,” he conceded, to be polite, “but I am quite sure that I have never told you this <i class="calibre3">particular</i> story. You see, as a boy I had a certain aptitude for marksmanship. And one spring—when I was about your age—there was a Ribbon Day at the academy in which we were all chosen to compete in different events—” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Weren’t you closer to thirteen?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What’s that?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Weren’t you thirteen when this happened?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The Count’s eyes went back and forth as he completed certain calculations. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well, yes,” he continued somewhat impatiently, “I suppose I was something like thirteen. The  <i class="calibre3">important</i> point is that given my marksmanship, I was generally regarded throughout the school as the favorite in the archery competition, and I looked forward to the event with great anticipation. But the closer we got to Ribbon Day, the worse my marksmanship became. Well known for piercing grapes at fifty paces, I suddenly couldn’t hit the hide of an elephant at fifteen feet. Just the sight of my bow made my hands shake and my eyes water. Suddenly, I—a Rostov</p>
<p class="calibre1">—found myself flirting with the notion of inventing an illness and checking into the infirmary—” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But you didn’t.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That’s right. I didn’t.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The Count took a sip of wine and paused for dramatic effect. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“At last the dreaded day arrived; and with all the spectators assembled on the sporting fields, the time came for the archery event. Even as I faced the target, I could anticipate the humiliation that was sure to follow when—</p>
<p class="calibre1">despite my reputation—my arrow would shoot wide of its mark. But as with</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p378"></a>trembling hands I drew back my bow, from the corner of my eye I happened to see old Professor Tartakov trip over his walking stick and topple into a pile of manure. Well, the sight filled me with such joy that my fingers released the bow of their own accord—” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“And having sailed through the air, your arrow landed in the center of the target.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well, yes. That’s right. The very center. So perhaps I have told you this story before. But did you know that ever since that day, when I have been anxious about my aim, I have thought of old Professor Tartakov tumbling into the manure and have reliably hit my mark.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The Count turned his hand in the air in a concluding flourish. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Sofia smiled but with a perplexed expression, as if she wasn’t quite sure why the renowned marksman had chosen to relay this particular tale at this particular time. So, the Count elaborated. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“In life, it is the same for all of us. We are bound to face moments of trepidation whether we venture onto the floor of the senate, the field of athletics, or . . . the stage of a concert hall.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Sofia stared at the Count, for a moment then let out a bright laugh. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The stage of a concert hall.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes,” said the Count, a little offended. “The stage of a concert hall.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Someone has told you about my conversation with Director Vavilov.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The Count rearranged his fork and knife, which had somehow become misaligned. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I may have heard something from someone,” he said noncommittally. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Papa. I am not afraid of performing with the orchestra before an audience.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Can you be so sure?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Positively.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You have never performed in a hall as large as the Palais Garnier. . . .” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I know.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“And the French are notoriously exacting as an audience. . . .” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Sofia laughed again. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well, if you’re trying to set me at ease, you’re not doing a very good job of it. But honestly, Papa, feelings of anxiety have nothing to do with my decision.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Then what?” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p379"></a>“I simply don’t want to go.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“How could you  <i class="calibre3">not</i> want to go?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Sofia looked down at the table and moved her own silver. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I like it here,” she said at last—gesturing to the room and, by extension, the hotel. “I like it here with you.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The Count studied his daughter. With her long black hair, fair skin, and dark blue eyes, she seemed serene beyond her years. And therein, perhaps, lay the problem. For if serenity should be a hallmark of maturity, then impetuousness should be a hallmark of youth. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I want to tell you a different story,” he said, “a story that I am sure you have never heard. It took place in this very hotel some thirty years ago—on a snowy night in December, much like this one. . . .” </p>
<p class="calibre1">And the Count went on to tell Sofia about the Christmas that he had celebrated with her mother in the Piazza in 1922. He told her about Nina’s hors d’oeuvre of ice creams, and her reluctance to sit in scholarly rows, and her argument that if one wished to broaden one’s horizons, one would best be served by venturing  <i class="calibre3">beyond</i> the horizon. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The Count suddenly grew somber. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I fear I have done you a great disservice, Sofia. From the time you were a child, I have lured you into a life that is principally circumscribed by the four walls of this building. We all have. Marina, Andrey, Emile, and I. We have ventured to make the hotel seem as wide and wonderful as the world, so that you would opt to spend more time in it with us. But your mother was perfectly right. One does not fulfill one’s potential by listening to <i class="calibre3">Scheherazade</i> in a gilded hall, or by reading the  <i class="calibre3">Odyssey</i> in one’s den. One does so by setting forth into the vast unknown—just like Marco Polo when he traveled to China, or Columbus when he traveled to America.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Sofia nodded in understanding. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The Count continued. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I have had countless reasons to be proud of you; and certainly one of the greatest was the night of the Conservatory competition. But the moment I felt that pride was not when you and Anna brought home news of your victory. It was earlier in the evening, when I watched you heading out the hotel’s doors on your way to the hall. For what matters in life is not whether we receive a round of applause; what matters is whether we have the courage to venture forth despite the uncertainty of acclaim.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p380"></a>“If I  <i class="calibre3">am</i> to play the piano in Paris,” said Sofia after a moment, “I only wish that you could be there in the audience to hear me.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The Count smiled. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I assure you, my dear, were you to play the piano on the moon, I would hear every chord.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p381"></a> <i class="calibre3"><b class="calibre4">Achilles Agonistes</b></i></p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre4">G</b>reetings, Arkady.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Greetings to you, Count Rostov. Is there something I can do for you this morning?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“If it wouldn’t be too much trouble, could you spare a bit of stationery?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Certainly.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Standing at the front desk, the Count penned a one-sentence note under the hotel’s moniker and addressed the envelope in an appropriately slanted script; he waited until the bell captain was otherwise occupied, casually crossed the lobby, slipped the note onto the bell captain’s desk, and then headed downstairs for his weekly visit to the barber. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It had been many years since Yaroslav Yaroslavl had worked his magic in the barbershop of the Metropol, and in the interim any number of successors had attempted to fill his shoes. The most recent fellow—Boris Something-or-other-ovich—was perfectly qualified to shorten a man’s hair; but he was neither the artist nor the conversationalist that Yaroslav had been. In fact, he went about his business with such mute efficiency, one suspected he was part machine. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Trim?” he asked the Count, wasting no time with subjects, verbs, or the other superfluities of language. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Given the Count’s thinning hair and the barber’s predisposition to efficiency, a trim might take all of ten minutes. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes, a trim,” said the Count. “But perhaps a shave as well. . . .” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The barber furrowed his brow. The man in him, no doubt, was inclined to point out that the Count had obviously shaved a few hours before; but the machinery in him was so finely tuned, it was already putting down the scissors and reaching for the shaving brush. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Having whipped a sufficient lather, Boris dabbed it on those areas of the Count’s face where whiskers would have been had the Count been in need of a shave. He sharpened one of his razors on his strop, leaned over the</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p382"></a><img class="calibre2" src="index-382_1.jpg"/></p>
<p class="calibre1">chair, and with an unflinching hand shaved the Count’s right upper cheek in a single pass. Wiping the blade on the towel at his waist, he then leaned over the Count’s left upper cheek, and shaved it with equal alacrity. </p>
<p class="calibre1">At this rate, fretted the Count <i class="calibre3">, </i> he’ll be done in a minute and a half. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Using a bent knuckle, the barber now raised the Count’s chin. The Count could feel the metal of the razor make contact with his throat. And that’s when one of the new bellhops appeared in the door. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Excuse me, sir.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes?” said the barber with his blade held fast at the Count’s jugular. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I have a note for you.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“On the bench.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But it is urgent,” said the young man with some anxiety. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Urgent?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes, sir. From the manager.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The barber looked back at the bellhop for the first time. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The manager?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes, sir.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">After an extended exhalation, the barber removed the blade from the Count’s throat, accepted the missive, and—as the bellhop disappeared down the hall—slit the envelope open with his razor. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Unfolding the note, the barber stared at it for a full minute. In those sixty seconds, he must have read it ten times over because it was composed of only four words:  <i class="calibre3">Come see me immediately! </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">The barber exhaled again then looked at the wall. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I can’t imagine,” he said to no one. Then having thought it over for another minute, he turned to the Count: “I must see to something.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“By all means. Do what you must. I am in no hurry.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">To underscore his point, the Count leaned back his head and closed his eyes as if to nap; but when the barber’s footsteps had receded down the hall, the Count leapt from the chair like a cat. </p>
<p class="calibre1">When the Count was a young man, he prided himself on the fact that he was unmoved by the ticking of the clock. In the early years of the twentieth century, there were those of his acquaintance who brought a new sense of</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p383"></a>urgency to their slightest endeavor. They timed the consumption of their breakfast, the walk to their office, and the hanging of their hat on its hook with as much precision as if they were preparing for a military campaign. </p>
<p class="calibre1">They answered the phone on the first ring, scanned the headlines, limited their conversations to whatever was most germane, and generally spent their days in pursuit of the second hand. God bless them. </p>
<p class="calibre1">For his part, the Count had opted for the life of the purposefully unrushed. Not only was he disinclined to race toward some appointed hour</p>
<p class="calibre1">—disdaining even to wear a watch—he took the greatest satisfaction when assuring a friend that a worldly matter could wait in favor of a leisurely lunch or a stroll along the embankment. After all, did not wine improve with age? Was it not the passage of years that gave a piece of furniture its delightful patina? When all was said and done, the endeavors that most modern men saw as urgent (such as appointments with bankers and the catching of trains), probably could have waited, while those they deemed frivolous (such as cups of tea and friendly chats) had deserved their immediate attention. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">Cups of tea and friendly chats! </i> the modern man objects.  <i class="calibre3">If one is to</i> <i class="calibre3">make time for such idle pursuits, how could one ever attend to the</i> <i class="calibre3">necessities of adulthood? </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">Luckily, the answer to this conundrum was provided by the philosopher Zeno in the fifth century B.C. Achilles, a man of action and urgency, trained to measure his exertions to the tenth of a second, should be able to quickly dispense with a twenty-yard dash. But in order to advance a yard, the hero must first advance eighteen inches; and in order to advance eighteen inches, he must first advance nine; but to advance nine, he must first advance four and a half, and so on. Thus, on his way to completing the twenty-yard dash, Achilles must traverse an infinite number of lengths—which, by definition, would take an infinite amount of time. By extension (as the Count had liked to point out), the man who has an appointment at twelve has an infinite number of intervals between now and then in which to pursue the satisfactions of the spirit. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">Quod erat demonstrandum. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">But ever since Sofia returned home that night in late December with word of the Conservatory’s tour, the Count had had a very different perspective on the passage of time. Before they’d even finished celebrating</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p384"></a>the news, he’d calculated that less than six months remained before she was scheduled to depart. One hundred and seventy-eight days, to be exact; or 356 chimings of the twice-tolling clock. And in that brief span, there was so much to be done. . . . </p>
<p class="calibre1">Given the Count’s membership as a younger man to the ranks of the purposefully unrushed, one might have expected the ticking of this clock to buzz around his ears like a mosquito in the night; or prompt him, like Oblomov, to turn on his side and face the wall in a state of malaise. But what occurred was the opposite. In the days that followed, it brightened his step, sharpened his senses, and quickened his wits. For just like the rousing of Humphrey Bogart’s indignation, the clock’s ticking revealed the Count to be a Man of Intent. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In the last week of December, one of the Catherines the Count had retrieved from the Grand Duke’s desk was brought by Vasily to the basement of TsUM and cashed in for store credit. With the proceeds, the concierge purchased a small tan valise along with other necessities of travel, such as a towel, soap, toothpaste, and a toothbrush. These were wrapped in festive paper and presented to Sofia on Christmas Eve (at midnight). </p>
<p class="calibre1">Per Director Vavilov, Sofia’s performance of Rachmaninov’s Second Piano Concerto was to be the penultimate piece on the program, followed by a violin prodigy’s performance of a Dvorak concerto, both with full orchestra. The Count had no doubt that Rachmaninov’s Second was well within Sofia’s grasp; but even Horowitz had his Tarnowsky. So in early January, the Count hired Viktor Stepanovich to help her rehearse. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In late January, the Count commissioned Marina to fashion a new dress for the concert. After a design meeting that included Marina, Anna, and Sofia—and which, for some incomprehensible reason, excluded the Count</p>
<p class="calibre1">—Vasily was dispatched back to TsUM for a bolt of blue taffeta. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Over the years, the Count had done an adequate job of teaching Sofia the rudiments of conversational French. Nonetheless, beginning in February, father and daughter set aside games of  <i class="calibre3">Zut</i> in order to review the more practical applications of the French language while they awaited their appetizers. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p385"></a><img class="calibre2" src="index-385_1.jpg"/></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">“Pardonnez-moi, Monsieur, avez-vous l’heure, s’il vous</i> <i class="calibre3">plaît?” </i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">“Oui, Mademoiselle, il est dix heures.” </i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">“Merci. Et pourriez-vous me dire où se trouvent les</i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">Champs-Élysées?” </i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">“Oui, continuez tout droit dans cette direction.” </i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">“Merci beaucoup.” </i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">“Je vous en prie.” </i></p>

<p class="calibre1">Then on the twenty-first of March, the Count penned the slanted one-sentence insistence under the hotel’s moniker, slipped it on the bell captain’s desk, went on his weekly visit to the barber, and waited for the note to arrive. . . . </p>
<p class="calibre1">Having poked his head into the hallway in order to watch Boris mount the stairs, the Count closed the barbershop door and turned his attention to Yaroslav’s renowned glass cabinet. At the front of the cabinet were two rows of large white bottles bearing the insignia of the Hammer and Sickle Shampoo Company. But behind these soldiers in the fight for universal cleanliness, all but forgotten, was a selection of the brightly colored bottles from the old days. Taking out several of the shampoo bottles, the Count surveyed the tonics, soaps, and oils—but couldn’t find what he was looking for. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It must be here, he thought. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p386"></a><img class="calibre2" src="index-386_1.jpg"/></p>

<p class="calibre1">The Count put the bottle in his pocket, reloaded the cabinet, and closed its doors. Scurrying back into his chair, he smoothed his smock and leaned back his head; but even as he closed his eyes, he was struck by the image of Boris slitting open the envelope with his razor. Leaping again from the chair, the Count snatched one of the spares from the counter, slipped it into his pocket, and resumed his place—just as the barber came through the door grumbling about fools’ errands and wasted time. </p>

<p class="calibre1">When he was done with the map, the Count went to his study and retrieved his father’s copy of Montaigne’s  <i class="calibre3">Essays</i> from the bookcase where it had resided in comfort ever since Sofia had liberated it from under the bureau. Taking the book back to the Grand Duke’s desk, the Count began turning through the pages, stopping here and there to read the passages his father had underlined. As he was lingering over a particular section in “Of the Education of Children,” the twice-tolling clock began to signal the hour of noon. </p>
<p class="calibre1">One hundred and seventy-three chimings to go, thought the Count. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Then issuing a sigh, he shook his head, crossed himself twice, and with Boris’s razor began removing the text from two hundred pages of the masterpiece. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p387"></a> <i class="calibre3"><b class="calibre4">Arrivederci</b></i></p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre4">O</b>ne evening in early May, as the Count sat in the high-back chair between the potted palms, over the top of his newspaper he spied the young Italian couple exiting the elevator. She was a long, dark beauty in a long, dark dress, and he a shorter man in slacks and jacket. The Count wasn’t certain what had brought the couple to Moscow, but they reliably left the hotel every evening at seven o’clock, presumably to avail themselves of the city’s nightlife. Case in point, when they stepped off the elevator at 6:55 they walked straight to the concierge’s desk, where Vasily was ready with two tickets for  <i class="calibre3">Boris Godunov</i> and a reservation for a late supper. Then the couple swung by the front desk in order to drop off their key, which Arkady stowed in the twenty-eighth slot of the fourth row. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Laying his newspaper on the table, the Count rose, yawned, and stretched. He strolled toward the revolving door as one who wishes to gauge the weather. Outside on the steps, Rodion exchanged greetings with the young couple, signaled a taxi, and held the back door open for them. </p>
<p class="calibre1">When they drove off, the Count spun on his heels and crossed the lobby to the stairs. Taking the steps one at a time (as had been his habit since 1952), he ascended to the fourth floor, traversed the hallway, and stopped before the twenty-eighth door. Easing two fingers into the ticket pocket of his vest, he extracted Nina’s key. Then with a look left and a look right, he let himself inside. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The Count had not been in room 428 since the early 1930s—when Anna was attempting to revive her career—but he wasted no time in assessing how the décor of the little sitting room had changed. Rather, he went straight into the bedroom and opened the left closet door. It was filled with dresses exactly like the one the dark beauty had been wearing tonight: knee length, short sleeved, monochromatic. (It was a look that suited her well, after all.) Closing her side of the closet, the Count opened the companion door. Inside were slacks and jackets on hangers, and the flat cap of a</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p388"></a><img class="calibre2" src="index-388_1.jpg"/></p>
<p class="calibre1">newsboy on a hook. Selecting a pair of tan pants, he closed the door. In the second drawer of the bureau, he found a white oxford. Removing a folded pillowcase from his pocket, he stuffed the clothes inside. He returned to the sitting room, opened the door a crack, confirmed the hallway was empty, and slipped out. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Only with the click of the latch did it occur to the Count that he should have taken the cap. But even as he poked his fingers back into his vest pocket, he heard the unmistakable sound of squeaking wheels. Taking three strides down the hallway, the Count disappeared into the belfry—just as Oleg from room service turned the corner, pushing his cart before him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">At eleven o’clock that night, the Count was in the Shalyapin reviewing his checklist over a snifter of brandy. The Catherines, the  <i class="calibre3">Baedeker</i>, the Fountain of Youth, the slacks and shirt, a heavy-duty needle and thread from Marina were all in hand. There were still a few things to accomplish, but only one significant loose end: the matter of notice. From the beginning, the Count had known that this would prove the most difficult element of the plan to achieve. After all, one could not simply send a telegram. But it wasn’t absolutely essential. If left no alternative, the Count was prepared to proceed without it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The Count emptied his glass with the intention of heading upstairs, but before he rose from his stool Audrius was there with the bottle. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“A splash on the house?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ever since turning sixty, the Count had generally refrained from alcohol after eleven, having found that late-night drinks, like unsettled children, were likely to wake you at three or four in the morning. But it would have been rude for the Count to refuse the bartender’s offer, especially after he had gone to the trouble of uncorking the bottle. So, accepting the splash with an appropriate expression of gratitude, the Count made himself comfortable and turned his attention to the small group of Americans laughing at the other end of the bar. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Once again, the source of good humor was the hapless salesman from Montclair, New Jersey. Having initially struggled to get anyone of influence on the phone, in April the American began securing face-to-face meetings</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p389"></a><img class="calibre2" src="index-389_1.jpg"/></p>
<p class="calibre1">with senior bureaucrats in every conceivable branch of government. He had met personally with officials at the People’s Commissariats of Food, Finance, Labor, Education, and even Foreign Affairs. Knowing that a vending machine had as much chance of selling in the Kremlin as a portrait of George Washington, the journalists had watched this turn of events in amazement. That is, until they learned that to better illustrate the function of his machines, Webster had asked his father to send him fifty cases of American cigarettes and chocolate bars. Thus, the salesman who had not been able to secure an appointment was suddenly welcomed into a hundred offices with open arms—and ushered out empty-handed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I really thought I had one on the line today,” he was saying. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As the American launched into the particulars of his near success, the Count was inevitably reminded of Richard, who was almost as wide-eyed as Webster, equally gregarious, and just as ready to tell a humorous tale at his own expense. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The Count set his glass down on the bar. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I wonder, he thought. Could it be possible? </p>
<p class="calibre1">But before the Count could answer his own question, the pudgy American waved a friendly hand at someone in the lobby—and who should return the wave but a certain eminent professor. . . . </p>
<p class="calibre1">Shortly after midnight, the American settled his bill at the bar, patted his companions on the shoulder, and wound up the stairs whistling an approximation of “The Internationale.” In the hallway on the fourth floor, he fumbled with his keys. But once the door to his room was closed, his posture became a little more straight, his expression a little more sober. </p>
<p class="calibre1">That’s when the Count switched on the lamp. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Though presumably startled to find a stranger sitting in one of his chairs, the American didn’t jump back or shout. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Excuse me,” he said with the smile of the inebriated. “I must be in the wrong room.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No,” said the Count. “You are in the right room.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well, if I am in the right room, then it must be you who are in the wrong room. . . .” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p390"></a><img class="calibre2" src="index-390_1.jpg"/></p>
<p class="calibre1">“Perhaps,” said the Count. “But I don’t think so.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The American took a step forward and studied his uninvited guest with a little more care. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Aren’t you the waiter in the Boyarsky?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes,” said the Count. “I am the waiter.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The American nodded slowly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I see. Mr. . . . ?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Rostov. Alexander Rostov.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well, Mr. Rostov, I’d offer you a drink, but the hour is late and I have a rather early appointment. Is there something else I can do for you?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes, Mr. Webster, I suspect that there is. You see, I have a letter that I need delivered to a friend in Paris, whom I think that you might know. . . .” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Despite the late hour and early appointment, Pudgy Webster ended up offering the Count a glass of whiskey, after all. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Now if, as a rule, the Count generally avoided drinking after eleven, he absolutely never drank after midnight. In fact, he had even found himself quoting his father to Sofia on the subject, asserting that the only things that came from the practice were foolhardy acts, ill-advised liaisons, and gambling debts. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But having snuck into the room of this American and arranged for a message to be delivered, it suddenly struck the Count that Humphrey Bogart would never turn down an offer of a drink after midnight. In fact, all evidence suggested that Bogart  <i class="calibre3">preferred</i> his drinking after midnight—</p>
<p class="calibre1">when the orchestra had stopped playing, the barstools had emptied, and the revelers had stumbled off into the night. That was the hour when, with the saloon doors closed, the lights turned low, and a bottle of whiskey on the table, Men of Intent could speak without the distractions of love and laughter. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes, thank you,” said the Count to Mr. Webster. “A glass of whiskey might just hit the spot.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">And as it turned out, the Count’s instincts had been perfectly right, for the glass of whiskey hit the spot. As did the second. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p391"></a>So when he finally bid Mr. Webster goodnight (with a package of American cigarettes for Anna in one pocket and a chocolate bar for Sofia in the other), the Count headed homeward in an elevated frame of mind. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The fourth-floor hallway was empty and still. Behind the line of closed doors slept the practical and predictable, the cautious and comfortable. </p>

<p class="calibre1">“Yes,” said the Count as he weaved down the hall: “<i class="calibre3">I</i> am the waiter.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Then with the finely attuned senses of his brotherhood, the Count noticed something suggestive out of the corner of his eye. It was the door to room 428. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">Boris Godunov</i> was a production of three and a half hours. A post-theater supper would last an hour and a half. So, in all likelihood, the Italians would not return to the hotel for another thirty minutes. The Count knocked and waited; he knocked again to be sure; then retrieving the key from his vest, he unlocked the door and crossed the threshold clear-eyed, quick, and without compunction. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In a glance, he could see that the night service had already visited the suite, for everything was in its proper place: the chairs, the magazines, the carafe of water and glasses. In the bedroom, he found the corners of the bed turned down at an angle of forty-five degrees. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Opening the right closet door, he was about to take the newsboy’s cap off its hook when he noticed something he’d missed before. On the shelf above the clothes was a bundle wrapped in paper and tied with twine—a bundle about the size of a small statuette. . . . </p>
<p class="calibre1">Putting the newsboy’s cap on his head, the Count took the bundle off the shelf and laid it on the bed. He untied the string and carefully peeled back the paper—only to find a set of Russian nesting dolls. Painted in a simple if traditional style, available in a hundred Moscow shops, the  <i class="calibre3">matryoshka</i> was just that sort of whimsical toy that two parents would bring home to their child from a trip to Russia. </p>
<p class="calibre1">And in which they could easily hide something . . . </p>
<p class="calibre1">Sitting on the bed, the Count opened the largest of the nesting dolls. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Then he opened the second largest of the nesting dolls. Then he opened the</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p392"></a><img class="calibre2" src="index-392_1.jpg"/></p>
<p class="calibre1">third largest of the nesting dolls. And he was about to open the fourth, when he heard a key in the lock. </p>
<p class="calibre1">For a moment, the Man of Intent was a Man Who Didn’t Know What to Do. But at the sound of the hallway door opening and the two Italian voices, the Count swept up the halves of the dolls, slipped into the closet, and quietly closed the door. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The shelf that ran above the hanging bar must have been less than six feet off the ground, because in order to fit in the closet, the Count had to bend his head like a penitent. (Point taken.)</p>
<p class="calibre1">It took only a few moments for the couple to shed their coats and come into the bedroom. If they went into the bathroom to perform their nightly toilette together, thought the Count, he would have the perfect opportunity to escape. But room 428 had only a small bath, and rather than crowd each other at the sink, the husband and wife chose to take turns. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Listening closely, the Count could hear the brushing of respective teeth, the opening of drawers, and the donning of pajamas. He could hear the bedsheets being pulled back. He could hear some quiet conversation, the lifting of books, and the turning of pages. After fifteen minutes, or an eternity, there was an exchange of endearments, a delicate kiss, and the lights went out. By the grace of God, this fine-looking couple opted for rest over intimacy. . . . </p>
<p class="calibre1">But how long, the Count wondered, would it take for them to fall asleep? Being careful not to move a muscle, he listened to their breathing. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He heard a cough; a sniff; a sigh. Then someone rolling on their side. He might have worried about falling asleep himself, if it weren’t for the crippling pain in his neck and the creeping realization that he would soon need a toilette of his own. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Well, there you have it, thought the Count: one more reason not to drink after midnight . . . </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">“Che cos ’era questo?! Tesoro, svegliati!” </i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">“Cos’è?” </i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">“C’è qualcuno nella stanza!” </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">. . . </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p393"></a>[Bump]</p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">“Chi è la?” </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">“Scusa.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">“Claudio! Accendi la luce!” </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">[Bam]</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Scusa.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">[Crash]</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Arrivederci!” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p394"></a> <i class="calibre3"><b class="calibre4">Adulthood</b></i></p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre4">A</b>re you ready?” asked Marina. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The Count and Anna, who were sitting side by side on the couch in the actress’s suite, answered in the affirmative. </p>
<p class="calibre1">With a fitting sense of ceremony, Marina opened the bedroom door to reveal Sofia. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The dress that the seamstress had fashioned for the concert was a long-sleeved gown in the trumpet style—fitted above the waist and flared below the knee. The blue of the fabric, which recalled the depths of the ocean, provided an otherworldly contrast to the fairness of Sofia’s skin and the blackness of her hair. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Anna let out a gasp. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Marina beamed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">And the Count? </p>
<p class="calibre1">Alexander Rostov was neither scientist nor sage; but at the age of sixty-four he was wise enough to know that life does not proceed by leaps and bounds. It unfolds. At any given moment, it is the manifestation of a thousand transitions. Our faculties wax and wane, our experiences accumulate, and our opinions evolve—if not glacially, then at least gradually. Such that the events of an average day are as likely to transform who we are as a pinch of pepper is to transform a stew. And yet, for the Count, when the doors to Anna’s bedroom opened and Sofia stepped forward in her gown, at that very moment she crossed the threshold into adulthood. On one side of that divide was a girl of five or ten or twenty with a quiet demeanor and a whimsical imagination who relied upon him for companionship and counsel; while on the other side was a young woman of discernment and grace who need rely on no one but herself. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well? What do you think?” asked Sofia shyly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’m speechless,” said the Count with unabashed pride. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You look magnificent,” said Anna. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p395"></a>“Doesn’t she, though?” said Marina. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Gay with the compliments and the sound of Anna’s applause, Sofia spun once on her feet. </p>

<p class="calibre1">The Count turned upon Anna. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I suppose this was  <i class="calibre3">your</i> doing!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The actress stopped clapping. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What was my doing?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He waved his hand in Sofia’s direction. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“This dressless dress. No doubt it was drawn from one of your <i class="calibre3">convenient</i> magazines.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Before Anna could respond, Marina stomped her foot. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“This was  <i class="calibre3">my</i> doing!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Startled by the seamstress’s tone, the Count saw with some trepidation that while one of her eyes had rolled toward the ceiling in exasperation, the other was bearing down on him like a cannonball. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It is a dress of  <i class="calibre3">my</i> design,” she said, “fashioned from  <i class="calibre3">my</i> handiwork for <i class="calibre3">my</i> Sofia.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Recognizing that he may have unintentionally insulted an artist, the Count adopted a more conciliatory tone. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It is unquestionably a beautiful dress, Marina. One of the finest I have ever seen; and I have seen many fine dresses in my time.” Here the Count gave an awkward little laugh in the hopes of clearing the air and then continued in a tone of fellowship and common sense. “But after months of preparation, Sofia will be performing Rachmaninov at the Palais Garnier. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Wouldn’t it be a pity if, instead of listening to her play, the audience was staring at her back?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Perhaps we should drape her in sackcloth,” suggested the seamstress. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“To ensure that the audience is not distracted.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I would never counsel sackcloth,” protested the Count. “But there is such a thing as moderation, even within the bounds of glamour.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Marina stomped her foot again. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p396"></a><img class="calibre2" src="index-396_1.jpg"/></p>
<p class="calibre1">“Enough! We have no interest in your scruples, Alexander Ilyich. Just because you witnessed the Comet of 1812, does not mean that Sofia must wear a petticoat and bustle.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The Count began to object, but Anna intervened. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Perhaps we should hear what Sofia has to say.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">They all looked to Sofia who, oblivious to the course of the debate, was admiring herself in the mirror. She turned and took Marina’s hands. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I think it’s splendid.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Marina looked at the Count in triumph; then turning back to Sofia, she tilted her head and studied her handiwork with a more critical eye. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What is it?” asked Anna, taking up a position beside the seamstress. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It needs something. . . .” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“A cape?” muttered the Count. </p>
<p class="calibre1">All three women ignored him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I know,” Anna said after a moment. Slipping into her bedroom, she returned with a choker that had a sapphire pendant. She handed it to Marina, who fastened it around Sofia’s neck, then the two older women stepped back. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Perfect,” they agreed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Is it true?” asked Anna, as she and the Count walked down the hallway after the fitting. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Is what true?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Did you really see the Comet of 1812?” </p>
